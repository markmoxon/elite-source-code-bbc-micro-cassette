\ Deep dive: The Elite memory map

\
\ The cassette version of Elite uses almost every nook and cranny of the BBC
\ Micro Model B, which isn't surprising when you consider just how much the
\ authors managed to squeeze into this 32K micro. Sure, the disc version of the
\ game has more features, but that's because the main game code is split into
\ two different programs, one that's loaded when you're docked and another
\ that's loaded for spaceflight. The cassette version that's documented here
\ doesn't have the luxury of fast loading - quite the opposite, in fact - so it
\ has to cram the whole game into memory, all at once. It's an absolute marvel
\ of efficiency.
\
\ When the cassette version of Elite is loaded, this is how the memory map of
\ the BBC Micro Model B looks.

\
\ This memory map shows the full 64K of addressable memory that's supported by
\ the BBC's 6502 processor, but only the bottom 32K is writable RAM, and hence
\ usable by Elite. The top 16K is mapped to the MOS (Machine operating system)
\ ROM, and the next 16K is mapped to the currently selected paged ROM, which
\ might be anything from BBC Basic to the VIEW word processor.
\
\ This 32K of RAM includes both screen memory and the various operating system
\ workspaces, which can leave a pretty small amount for programs (especially in
\ high resolution screen modes). Let's take a look at how the authors managed to
\ shoehorn their game into such a small amount of memory.
\

\                               Total memory                   65,536
\
\ As you can see - and contrary to popular legend - Elite does not use every
\ single last byte of the BBC Micro's usable memory. There are actually quite a
\ few unused bytes in the cassette version, as noted in the "Unused" column
\ above; 66 of them, to be precise. Here are the details, in the order in which
\ they appear above:
\
\   * In the main game code:
\
\     * There are six unused bytes in the last saved commander data at NA%. Two
\       of them are between LASER and CRGO, just after the four laser powers;
\       they were originally used for up and down lasers, but those views were
\       dropped and the space never reclaimed. There are four more unused bytes
\       between the escape pod at ESCP and the cargo bay capacity at CRGO, which
\       might have been for additional equipment that didn't get implemented...
\       who knows?
\
\     * There's an unused and unlabelled duplicate of the multiplication routine
\       MULTU sandwiched between FMLTU and MLTU2 that takes up 24 bytes
\
\     * The MUT3 routine is never called and would be identical to MUT2 even if
\       it were, so that's another four bytes that aren't used
\
\   * In the recursive token table at QQ18:
\
\     * There is one unused byte at &07FF, right at the end of the table
\
\   * In the WP workspace:
\
\     * The one-byte variable XX24 is never used
\
\     * There are 12 bytes at the end of the WP workspace, from &0F34 to &0F40,
\       which aren't used
\
\   * In the Python workspace:
\
\     * There are 11 unused bytes between the end of the Python ship blueprint
\       and the SVN and VEC variables, right at the top of user memory
\
\   * In the zero page workspace:
\
\     * The one-byte variable XX14 is never used
\
\   * In the T% workspace:
\
\     * There are six unused bytes in the current commander data block at T%,
\       which correspond with the unused bytes in the last saved commander data
\       block at NA% (see above)
\
\ On top of this, there are quite a few instructions in the main game code that
\ have no effect and could have been culled without impact; I've identified 20
\ of them, but there are no doubt more of them to find (search the comments for
\ "no effect" to find the ones I've spotted).
\
\ But this is splitting hairs, as Elite swells the BBC Micro to near bursting
\ point while being both incredibly clever and incredibly efficient, and for
\ that, very serious respect is due to the authors.
\
\ Shared locations
\ ----------------
\ Some locations have two names in the source code. This is partly because some
\ of the code was developed on an Acorn Atom, which restricts the names you can
\ use for labels to two letters followed by one or more numbers. Presumably when
\ this code was merged with the code that was developed on a BBC Micro, where
\ label naming is more flexible, it was easier just to share label names than
\ refactor the Atom code.
\
\ The following label names point to the same locations in memory, and are
\ therefore interchangeable:
\
\   LOIN        = LL30
\   INWK        = XX1
\   INWK(34 33) = XX19(1 0)
\   X1          = XX15
\   Y1          = XX15+1
\   X2          = XX15+2
\   Y2          = XX15+3
\   K5          = XX18         = QQ17
\   K3          = XX2
\   LSO         = LSX
\   CABTMP      = MANY
\
\ The last one is slightly different, in that the first byte of the MANY table
\ is unused, so CABTMP simply makes the most of the otherwise unused location.

\
\ Summary: Printing recursive text tokens, two-letter tokens and control codes
\
\ References: TT27, BPRNT, TT26
\
\ There are an awful lot of routines for printing text in Elite, covering
\ everything from the formatting of huge decimal numbers to printing individual
\ spaces, but under the hood they all boil down to three core routines:
\
\   * TT27, which prints text tokens
\
\   * BPRNT, which prints numbers (for more information on this, see the deep
\     dive on "Printing decimal numbers")
\
\   * TT26, which pokes individual characters into screen memory
\
\ This deep dive looks at the last of these three routines, which forms the
\ heart of Elite's text tokenisation system. There are three types of text token
\ used by Elite - recursive tokens, two-letter tokens and control codes - so
\ let's look at how they all work.
\
\ Tokenisation
\ ------------
\ Elite uses a tokenisation system to store most of the the text that it
\ displays in the game. This enables the game to store strings more efficiently
\ than would be the case if they were simply inserted into the source code using
\ EQUS, and it also makes it possible to build text strings, like system names,
\ using procedural generation.
\
\ To support tokenisation, characters are printed to the screen using a special
\ subroutine, TT27, which not only supports the usual range of letters, numbers
\ and punctuation, but also three different types of token. When printed, these
\ tokens get expanded into longer strings, which enables the game to squeeze a
\ lot of text into a small amount of storage.
\
\ To print something, you pass a character code in A to the printing routine at
\ TT27. The character code determines what gets printed, as follows:
\
\   Code in A     Text or token that gets printed
\   ---------     -------------------------------------------------------------
\   0-13          Control codes 0-13
\   14-31         Recursive tokens 128-145 (i.e. print token number A + 114)
\   32-95         Normal ASCII characters 32-95 (0-9, A-Z and most punctuation)
\   96-127        Recursive tokens 96-127 (i.e. print token number A)
\   128-159       Two-letter tokens 128-159
\   160-255       Recursive tokens 0-95 (i.e. print token number A - 160)
\
\ Codes 32-95 represent the normal ASCII characters from " " to "_", so a value
\ of 65 represents the letter A (as "A" has character code 65 in the BBC Micro's
\ character set).
\
\ All other character codes (0-31 and 96-255) represent tokens, and they can
\ print anything from single characters to entire sentences. In the case of
\ recursive tokens, the tokens can themselves contain other tokens, and in this
\ way long strings can be stored in very few bytes, at the expense of code
\ readability and speed.
\
\ To make things easier to follow in the discussion and comments below, let's
\ refer to the three token types like this, where n is the character code:
\
\   {n}           Control code              n = 0 to 13
\   <n>           Two-letter token          n = 128 to 159
\   [n]           Recursive token           n = 0 to 148
\
\ So when we say {13} we're talking about control code 13 ("crlf"), while <141>
\ is the two-letter token 141 ("DI"), and [3] is the recursive token 3 ("DATA
\ ON {current system}"). The brackets are just there to make things easier to
\ understand when following the code, because the way these tokens are stored
\ in memory and passed to subroutines is confusing, to say the least.
\
\ We'll take a look at each of the three token types in more detail below, but
\ first a word about the two routines for printing characters in Elite.
\
\ The TT27 print subroutine
\ -------------------------
\ As mentioned above, Elite contains a subroutine at TT27 that prints out the
\ character code given in the accumulator, and if that number refers to a token,
\ then the token is expanded before being printed. This is how almost all of the
\ text in the game gets put on the screen. For example, the following code:
\
\   LDA #65
\   JSR TT27
\
\ prints a capital A, while this code:
\
\   LDA #163
\   JSR TT27
\
\ prints recursive token number 3 (see below for more on why we pass a value of
\ 163 instead of 3). This would produce the following if we were currently
\ visiting the lore-heavy system of Tionisla:
\
\   DATA ON TIONISLA
\
\ This is because token 3 expands to the string "DATA ON {current system}". You
\ can see this very call being used in routine TT25, which displays data on the
\ selected system when red key f6 is pressed (this particular call prints the
\ title at the top of the screen).
\
\ The ex print subroutine
\ -----------------------
\ There are 149 recursive tokens in all, numbered from 0 to 148, but the TT27
\ routine can only print tokens 0 to 145. So how do we print recursive tokens
\ 146, 147 and 148?
\
\ Luckily there is another subroutine at ex that always prints the recursive
\ token number given in the accumulator, so we can use that to print these
\ tokens. So this, for example, is how we print "GAME OVER":
\
\   LDA #146
\   JSR ex
\
\ Incidentally, the ex subroutine is what TT27 calls when it has analysed the
\ character code, determined that it is a recursive token, and subtracted 160
\ or added 114 as appropriate to get the token number, so calling ex directly
\ with 146-148 in the accumulator is doing exactly the same thing, just without
\ all the preamble.
\
\ Control codes: {n}
\ ------------------
\ Control codes are in the range 0 to 13, and expand to the following when
\ printed via TT27:
\
\   0   Current cash, right-aligned to width 9, then " CR", newline
\   1   Current galaxy number, right-aligned to width 3
\   2   Current system name
\   3   Selected system name (the crosshairs in the Short-range Chart)
\   4   Commander's name
\   5   "FUEL: ", fuel level, " LIGHT YEARS", newline, "CASH:", {0}, newline
\   6   Switch case to Sentence Case
\   7   Beep
\   8   Switch case to ALL CAPS
\   9   Tab to column 21, then print a colon
\   10  Line feed (i.e. move cursor down)
\   11  (not used, does the same as 13)
\   12  (not used, does the same as 13)
\   13  Newline (i.e. carriage return and line feed)
\
\ So a value of 4 in a tokenised string will be expanded to the current
\ commander's name, while a value of 5 will print the current fuel level in the
\ format "FUEL: 5.3 LIGHT YEARS", followed by a newline, followed by "CASH: ",
\ and then control code 0 - which shows the amount of cash to one significant
\ figure, right-aligned to a width of 9 characters - before finishing off with
\ " CR" and another newline. The result is something like this, when displayed
\ in Sentence Case:
\
\   Fuel: 6.7 Light Years
\   Cash:    1234.5 Cr
\
\ If you press f8 to show the Status Mode screen, you can see control code 4
\ being used to show the commander's name in the title, while control code 5 is
\ responsible for displaying the fuel and cash lines.
\
\ When talking about encoded strings in the code comments below, control
\ characters are shown as {n}, so {4} expands to the commander's name and {5}
\ to the current fuel.
\
\ By default, Elite prints words using Sentence Case, where the first letter of
\ each word is capitalised. Control code {8} can be used to switch to ALL CAPS
\ (so it acts like Caps Lock), and {6} can be used to switch back to Sentence
\ Case. You can see this in action on the Status Mode screen, where the title
\ and equipment headers are in ALL CAPS, while everything else is in Sentence
\ Case. Tokens are stored using capital letters only, and each letter's case is
\ determined by the logic in TT27 before it is printed.
\
\ Two-letter tokens: <n>
\ ----------------------
\ Two-letter tokens expand to the following:
\
\   128     AL
\   129     LE
\   130     XE
\   131     GE
\   132     ZA
\   133     CE
\   134     BI
\   135     SO
\   136     US
\   137     ES
\   138     AR
\   139     MA
\   140     IN
\   141     DI
\   142     RE
\   143     A?
\   144     ER
\   145     AT
\   146     EN
\   147     BE
\   148     RA
\   149     LA
\   150     VE
\   151     TI
\   152     ED
\   153     OR
\   154     QU
\   155     AN
\   156     TE
\   157     IS
\   158     RI
\   159     ON
\
\ So a value of 150 in a tokenised string would expand to VE, for example. When
\ talking about encoded strings in the code comments below, two-letter tokens
\ are shown as <n>, so <150> expands to VE.
\
\ The set of two-letter tokens is stored at location QQ16, in a two-byte lookup
\ table. This table is also used to generate system names procedurally, as
\ described in the deep dive on "Generating system names".
\
\ Note that question marks in two-letter tokens are not printed, so token <143>
\ expands to "A" rather than "A?". This allows names with an odd number of
\ characters to be generated from sequences of two-letter tokens, though they do
\ have to contain the letter A, as token <143> is the only one of its type.
\
\ Recursive tokens: [n]
\ ---------------------
\ The binary file that is generated by this part of the main source file
\ (WORDS9.bin) contains 149 recursive tokens, numbered from 0 to 148, which are
\ stored from &0400 to &06FF in a tokenised form. These tokenised strings can
\ include references to other tokens, hence "recursive".
\
\ When talking about encoded strings in the code comments below, recursive
\ tokens are shown as [n], so [111] expands to "FUEL SCOOPS", for example, and
\ [110] expands to "[102][104]S", which in turn expands to "EXTRA BEAM LASERS"
\ (as [102] expands to "EXTRA " and [104] to "BEAM LASER").
\
\ The recursive tokens are numbered from 0 to 148, but because we've already
\ reserved codes 0-13 for control characters, 32-95 for ASCII characters and
\ 128-159 for two-letter tokens, we can't just send the token number straight
\ to TT27 to print it out (sending 65 to TT27 prints "A", for example, and not
\ recursive token 65). So instead, we use the following from the table above to
\ work out what to send to TT27:
\
\   Code in A     Text or token that gets printed
\   ---------     -------------------------------------------------------------
\   14-31         Recursive tokens 128-145 (i.e. print token number A + 114)
\   96-127        Recursive tokens 96-127 (i.e. print token number A)
\   160-255       Recursive tokens 0-95 (i.e. print token number A - 160)
\
\ The first column is the number we need to send to TT27 in the accumulator to
\ print the token described in the second column.
\
\ So, if we want to print recursive token 132, then according to the first row
\ in this table, we need to subtract 114 to get 18, and send that to TT27.
\
\ Meanwhile, if we want to print token 101, then according to the second row,
\ we can just pass that straight through to TT27.
\
\ Finally, if we want to print token 3, then according to the third row, we
\ need to add 160 to get 163.
\
\ Note that, as described in the section on the ex routine above, you can't use
\ TT27 to print recursive tokens 146-148, but instead you need to call the ex
\ subroutine. The method described here only applies to recursive tokens 0-145.
\
\ How recursive tokens are stored in memory
\ -----------------------------------------
\ The 149 recursive tokens are stored one after the other in memory, starting
\ at &0400, with each token being terminated by a null character (EQUB 0).
\
\ To complicate matters, the strings themselves are all EOR'd with 35 before
\ being stored, and this process is repeated when they are read from memory (as
\ EOR is reversible). This is done in the routine at TT50.
\
\ Note that if a recursive token contains another recursive token, then that
\ token's number is stored as the number that would be sent to TT27, rather
\ than the number of the token itself.
\
\ All of this makes it pretty challenging to work out how one would store a
\ specific token in memory, which is why this file uses a handful of macros to
\ make life easier. They are:
\
\   CHAR n          Insert ASCII character n        n = 32 to 95
\   CTRL n          Insert control code n           n = 0 to 13
\   TWOK 'x', 'x'   Insert two-letter token "xy"    "xy" is in the table above
\   RTOK n          Insert recursive token n        n = 0 to 148
\
\ A side effect of all this obfuscation is that tokenised strings can't contain
\ ASCII 35 characters ("#"). This is because ASCII "#" EOR 35 is 0, and the
\ null character is already used to terminate our tokens in memory, so if you
\ did have a string containing the hash character, it wouldn't print the hash,
\ but would instead terminate at the character before.
\
\ Interestingly, there's no lookup table for each recursive token's starting
\ point in memory, as that would take up too much space, so to get hold of the
\ encoded string for a specific recursive token, the print routine runs through
\ the entire list of tokens, character by character, counting all the nulls
\ until it reaches the right spot. This might not be fast, but it is much more
\ space-efficient than a lookup table would be. You can see this loop in the
\ subroutine at ex, which is where recursive tokens are printed.
\
\ An example
\ ----------
\ Given all this, let's consider recursive token 3 again, which is printed
\ using the following code (remember, we have to add 160 to 3 to get the value
\ to pass through to TT27):
\
\   LDA #163
\   JSR TT27
\
\ Token 3 is stored in the tokenised form:
\
\   D<145>A[131]{3}
\
\ which we could store in memory using the following (adding in the null
\ terminator at the end and knowing that two-letter token 145 is "AT"):
\
\   CHAR 'D'
\   TWOK 'A', 'T'
\   CHAR 'A'
\   RTOK 131
\   CTRL 3
\   EQUB 0
\
\ As mentioned above, the values that are actually stored are EOR'd with 35,
\ and token [131] has to have 114 taken off it before it's ready for TT27, so
\ the bytes that are actually stored in memory for this token are:
\
\   EQUB 'D' EOR 35
\   EQUB 145 EOR 35
\   EQUB 'A' EOR 35
\   EQUB (131 - 114) EOR 35
\   EQUB 3 EOR 35
\   EQUB 0
\
\ or, as they would appear in the raw WORDS9.bin file, this:
\
\   EQUB &67, &B2, &62, &32, &20, &00
\
\ These all produce the same output, but the first version is rather easier to
\ understand.
\
\ Now that the token is stored in memory, we can call TT27 with the accumulator
\ set to 163, and the token will be printed as follows:
\
\   D             The letter D                  "D"
\   <145>         Two-letter token 145          "AT"
\   A             The letter A                  "A"
\   [131]         Recursive token 131           " ON "
\   {3}           Control character 3           The selected system name
\
\ So if the system under the crosshairs in the Short-range Chart is Tionisla,
\ this expands into "DATA ON TIONISLA", all of which is stored in just six
\ bytes.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Contains ship data for all the ships, planets, suns and space stations in our

\
\ The blocks are pointed to by the lookup table at location UNIV. The first 468
\ bytes of the K% workspace hold ship data on up to 13 ships, with 36 (NI%)
\ bytes per ship, and the ship line heap grows downwards from WP at the end of
\ the K% workspace.
\

\
\ Deep dive: Ship data blocks
\ ===========================
\
\ Summary: Storing data for each of the ships in the local bubble of universe
\
\ References: K%, INWK
\
\ Every ship in our local bubble of universe has its own data block, stored in
\ the K% workspace. The ship data block contains information about the ship's
\ status, its location in space, its orientation and so on. Each ship in the
\ local bubble has an entry in the lookup table at UNIV that points to its data
\ block in K%, and along with the ship slots at FRIN and the ship blueprints at
\ XX21, we have everything we need to simulate the world of Elite.
\
\ Before going any further, some important notes on how we're going to talk
\ about ships and ship data blocks.
\
\ Ship data terminology
\ ---------------------
\ Throughout this documentation, we're going to refer to "ships" and "ship data
\ blocks" for all the different object types in the vicinity, not just ships.
\ The same blocks, pointers and data structures are used not only for ships, but
\ also for cargo canisters, missiles, escape pods, asteroids, space stations,
\ planets and suns, but that's a bit of a mouthful compared to "ships", so
\ "ships" it is.
\
\ When working with a ship's data - such as when we move a ship in MVEIT, or
\ spawn a child ship in SFS1 - we normally work with the data in the INWK
\ workspace, as INWK is in zero page and is therefore faster and more memory
\ efficient to manipulate. The ship data blocks in the K% workspace are
\ therefore copied into INWK before they are worked on, and new ship blocks
\ are created in INWK before being copied to K%. As a result, the layout of the
\ INWK data block is identical the layout of each ship data block in K%.
\
\ It's also important to note that INWK is known as XX1 in some parts of the
\ codebase, namely those parts that were written by David Braben on his Acorn
\ Atom, where he was only allowed to use label names starting with two letters,
\ followed by numbers (this is why the source code is full of catchy labels like
\ TT26 and LL9). Because we might end up talking about ship data in INWK, K% or
\ XX1, this commentary refers to "ship byte #5" for byte #5 of the ship data
\ (y_sign), or "ship byte #32" for byte #32 (the AI flag), and so on. Most of
\ the time we will be working with INWK or XX1, but every now and then the bytes
\ in the K% block are manipulated directly, which we will point out in the
\ comments.
\
\ There are 36 bytes of data in each ship's block, and as mentioned above, they
\ all have the same format, though not all bytes are used for all ship types.
\ Planets, for example, don't have AI or missiles, though it would be fun if
\ they did...
\
\ Let's take a look at the format of a typical ship data block.
\
\ Summary of the ship data block format
\ -------------------------------------
\ The bytes in each ship data block are arranged as follows:
\
\   * Bytes #0-2        Ship's x-coordinate in space = (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\
\   * Bytes #3-5        Ship's y-coordinate in space = (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\
\   * Bytes #6-8        Ship's z-coordinate in space = (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\   * Bytes #9-14       Orientation vector nosev = [ nosev_x nosev_y nosev_z ]
\
\   * Bytes #15-19      Orientation vector roofv = [ roofv_x roofv_y roofv_z ]
\
\   * Bytes #21-26      Orientation vector sidev = [ sidev_x sidev_y sidev_z ]
\
\   * Byte #27          Speed
\
\   * Byte #28          Acceleration
\
\   * Byte #29          Roll counter
\
\   * Byte #30          Pitch counter
\
\   * Byte #31          Exploding state
\                       Killed state
\                       "Is being drawn on-screen" flag
\                       "Is visible on the scanner" flag
\                       Missile count
\
\   * Byte #32          AI flag
\                       Hostility flag
\                       Aggression level
\                       E.C.M. flag
\
\   * Bytes #33-34      Ship line heap address pointer
\
\   * Byte #35          Energy level
\
\ Let's look at these in more detail.
\
\ Ship coordinates (bytes #0-8)
\ -----------------------------
\ These bytes contain the ship's location in space relative to our ship. The
\ x-axis goes to the right, the y-axis goes up and the z-axis goes into the
\ screen.
\
\   * Byte #0 = x_lo
\   * Byte #1 = x_hi
\   * Byte #2 = x_sign
\
\   * Byte #3 = y_lo
\   * Byte #4 = y_hi
\   * Byte #5 = y_sign
\
\   * Byte #6 = z_lo
\   * Byte #7 = z_hi
\   * Byte #8 = z_sign
\
\ The coordinates are stored as 24-bit sign-magnitude numbers, where the sign of
\ the number is stored in bit 7 of the sign byte, and the other 23 bits contain
\ the magnitude of the number without any sign (i.e. the absolute values |x|,
\ |y| and |z|).
\
\ We can also write the coordinates like this:
\
\   * x-coordinate = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = INWK(2 1 0)
\   * y-coordinate = (y_sign y_hi y_lo) = INWK(5 4 3)
\   * z-coordinate = (z_sign z_hi z_lo) = INWK(8 7 6)
\
\ Orientation vectors (bytes #9-26)
\ ---------------------------------
\ The ship's orientation vectors determine its orientation in space. There are
\ three vectors, named according to the direction they point in (i.e. out of the
\ ship's nose, the ship's roof, or the ship's right side):
\
\   * Byte #9  = nosev_x_lo
\   * Byte #10 = nosev_x_hi
\   * Byte #11 = nosev_y_lo
\   * Byte #12 = nosev_y_hi
\   * Byte #13 = nosev_z_lo
\   * Byte #14 = nosev_z_hi
\
\   * Byte #15 = roofv_x_lo
\   * Byte #16 = roofv_x_hi
\   * Byte #17 = roofv_y_lo
\   * Byte #18 = roofv_y_hi
\   * Byte #19 = roofv_z_lo
\   * Byte #20 = roofv_z_hi
\
\   * Byte #21 = sidev_x_lo
\   * Byte #22 = sidev_x_hi
\   * Byte #23 = sidev_y_lo
\   * Byte #24 = sidev_y_hi
\   * Byte #25 = sidev_z_lo
\   * Byte #26 = sidev_z_hi
\
\ The vector coordinates are stored as 16-bit sign-magnitude numbers, where the
\ sign of the number is stored in bit 7 of the high byte. See the deep dive on
\ "Orientation vectors" for more information.
\
\ Ship movement (bytes #27-30)
\ ----------------------------
\ This block controls the ship's movement in space.
\
\   * Byte #27 = Speed, in the range 1-40
\
\   * Byte #28 = Acceleration, which gets added to the speed once, in MVEIT,
\     before being zeroed again
\
\   * Byte #29 = Roll counter
\
\     * Bits 0-6 = The counter. If this is 127 (%1111111) then damping is
\       disabled and the ship keeps rolling forever, otherwise damping is
\       enabled and the counter reduces by 1 for every iteration of the main
\       flight loop. The ship rolls by a fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6
\       degrees) for every iteration where the counter is > 0
\
\     * Bit 7 = The direction of roll
\
\   * Byte #30 = Pitch counter
\
\     * Bits 0-6 = The counter. If this is 127 (%1111111) then damping is
\       disabled and the ship keeps pitching forever, otherwise damping is
\       enabled and the counter reduces by 1 for every iteration of the main
\       flight loop. The ship pitches by a fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6
\       degrees) for every iteration where the counter is > 0
\
\     * Bit 7 = The direction of pitch
\
\ See the deep dive on "Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle" for more details
\ on the pitch and roll that the above counters apply to a ship.
\
\ Ship flags (bytes #31-32)
\ -------------------------
\ These two flags contain a lot of information about the ship, and they are
\ consulted often.
\
\   * Byte #31 = Exploding state, Killed state, "Is being drawn on-screen" flag,
\     "Is visible on the scanner" flag, Missile count
\
\     * Bits 0-2: %nnn = number of missiles or Thargons (maximum 7)
\
\     * Bit 3:    0 = isn't currently being drawn on-screen
\                 1 = is currently being drawn on-screen
\
\     * Bit 4:    0 = don't show on scanner
\                 1 = do show on scanner
\
\     * Bit 5:    0 = ship is not exploding
\                 1 = ship is exploding
\
\     * Bit 6:    0 = ship is not firing lasers
\                 1 = ship is firing lasers
\                 0 = explosion has not been drawn
\                 1 = explosion has been drawn
\
\     * Bit 7:    0 = ship has not been killed
\                 1 = ship has been killed
\
\   * Byte #32 = AI flag, Hostility flag, Aggression level, E.C.M. flag
\
\     * For ships:
\
\       * Bit 0:    0 = no E.C.M.
\                   1 = has E.C.M.
\
\       * Bits 1-5: n = aggression level (see TACTICS part 7)
\
\       * Bit 6:    0 = friendly
\                   1 = hostile
\
\       * Bit 7:    0 = dumb
\                   1 = AI enabled (tactics get applied by the TACTICS routine)
\
\     * For the space station:
\
\       * Bit 7:    0 = friendly
\                   1 = hostile
\
\     * For missiles:
\
\       * Bit 0:    0 = no lock/launched
\                   1 = target locked
\
\       * Bits 1-4: %nnnn = target's slot number (maximum 15)
\
\       * Bit 6:    0 = friendly
\                   1 = hostile
\
\       * Bit 7:    0 = dumb
\                   1 = AI enabled (tactics get applied)
\
\ Heap pointer and energy (bytes #33-34)
\ --------------------------------------
\ The final two bytes are as follows:
\
\   * Byte #33 = low byte of ship line heap address pointer in INWK(34 33)
\
\   * Byte #34 = high byte of ship line heap address pointer in INWK(34 33)
\
\   * Byte #35 = ship energy

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Calculate the alpha and beta angles from the current pitch and roll
\
\ Here we take the current rate of pitch and roll, as set by the joystick or
\ keyboard, and convert them into alpha and beta angles that we can use in the
\ matrix functions to rotate space around our ship. The alpha angle covers
\ roll, while the beta angle covers pitch (there is no yaw in this version of
\ Elite). The angles are in radians, which allows us to use the small angle
\ approximation when moving objects in the sky (see the MVEIT routine for more
\ on this). Also, the signs of the two angles are stored separately, in both
\ the sign and the flipped sign, as this makes calculations easier.

 JSR cntr               \ rate in X creeps towards the centre by 2

                        \ The roll rate in JSTX increases if we press ">" (and
                        \ the RL indicator on the dashboard goes to the right).
                        \ This rolls our ship to the right (clockwise), but we

                        \ to the left (anticlockwise), so a positive roll rate
                        \ in JSTX translates to a negative roll angle alpha

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Scan for flight keys and process the results
\
\ Flight keys are logged in the key logger at location KY1 onwards, with a
\ non-zero value in the relevant location indicating a key press. See the deep
\ dive on "The key logger" for more details.
\
\ The key presses that are processed are as follows:
\
\   * Space and "?" to speed up and slow down
\   * "U", "T" and "M" to disarm, arm and fire missiles
\   * Tab to fire an energy bomb
\   * Escape to launch an escape pod
\   * "J" to initiate an in-system jump
\   * "E" to deploy E.C.M. anti-missile countermeasures
\   * "C" to use the docking computer
\   * "A" to fire lasers

\ Deep dive: Program flow of the ship-moving routine
\ ==================================================
\
\ Summary: A breakdown of the routine that moves the entire universe around us
\
\ References: MVEIT
\
\ The Elite universe is well-known for being immersive, and one of the most
\ convincing aspects of the bubble of universe around our Cobra Mk III is how
\ all the other objects around us move independently, from ships and space
\ stations to entire planets and suns. This is no static universe with chunky
\ bitmap backdrops or the predictable alien shuffle of Space Invaders - this is
\ a convincing reality where pirates fly rings around rookie pilots while
\ Coriolis stations pump out wave after wave of deadly law-enforcing Vipers.
\
\ So it's no surprise that the main ship-moving routine at MVEIT does a lot of
\ heavy lifting. That said, the amount of effort is greatly reduced by the fact
\ that the universe rotates around our ship, rather than the other way round.
\ When we pitch or roll our Cobra, our ship actually stays put and the game
\ rotates the entire universe around us in the opposite direction to the way
\ we're rotating. The end result is the same because the universe is nice and
\ simple, but the calculations are a lot easier to implement.
\
\ The MVEIT routine gets called by the main flight loop for each nearby ship.
\ It rotates the current ship by the pitch and roll angles (which are set up
\ to move the univers in the correct direction) while also applying the ship's
\ own individual movements, such as its speed, orientation changes, and so on.
\
\ The MVEIT also calls the TACTICS routine to apply tactics to ships with AI
\ enabled (see the deep dive on "Program flow of the tactics routine" for more
\ details).
\
\ Program flow
\ ------------
\ Here's a breakdown of how the game implements a universe that literally
\ revolves around us.
\
\ 1/9 MVEIT (main entry point for moving)
\
\   * Tidy the orientation vectors for one of the ship slots (by calling TIDY)
\
\ 2/9
\
\   * Apply tactics to ships with AI enabled (by calling TACTICS)
\   * Remove the ship from the scanner, so we can move it (by calling SCAN)
\
\ 3/9
\
\   * Move the ship forward (along the vector pointing in the direction of
\     travel) according to its speed
\
\ 4/9
\
\   * Apply acceleration to the ship's speed (if acceleration is non-zero), and
\     then zero the acceleration as it's a one-off change
\
\ 5/9
\
\   * Rotate the ship's location in space by the amount of pitch and roll of our
\     ship
\
\ 6/9
\
\   * Move the ship in space according to our speed
\
\ 7/9
\
\   * Rotate the ship's orientation vectors according to our pitch and roll
\     (MVS4)
\
\ 8/9
\
\   * If the ship we are processing is rolling or pitching itself, rotate it and
\     apply damping if required
\
\ 9/9
\
\   * If the ship is exploding or being removed, hide it on the scanner
\   * Otherwise redraw the ship on the scanner, now that it's been moved

\ Deep dive: Docking checks
\ =========================
\
\ Summary: The checks that determine whether we are docking... or just crashing
\
\ References: ISDK, Main flight loop (Part 9 of 16)
\
\ Docking is difficult, there's no doubt about it. The challenge of slotting
\ into one of Elite's rotating Coriolis space stations is absolutely iconic, and
\ for almost everyone, the first few attempts to match the station's rotation
\ while heading into the middle of the slot end in messy failure. It is one of
\ the biggest hurdles to overcome in the early game, but to progress you have to
\ master the art to the point where it's almost a shame when you can afford a
\ docking computer to handle things for you. Almost.
\
\ But how does the game know when we successfully snake into the docking bay,
\ rather than crashing into the station walls, leaving nothing but a trail of
\ sparks and dented pride? The routine at ISDK houses the heart of the docking
\ algorithm, which watches us nervously line up with the planet-facing side of
\ the station, and judges whether our approach is nominal or abominable.
\
\ Specifically, the ISDK routine does five tests to confirm whether we are
\ docking safely. They are:
\
\   1. Friend or foe: Confirm that the station isn't hostile, because stations
\      have feelings too - feelings and whole nests of Vipers
\
\   2. Orientation: Confirm that our ship is pointing in the right direction, by
\      checking that the angle that we are facing is within 26 degrees of the
\      perfect, head-on approach
\
\   3. Heading: Confirm that we are facing towards the space station
\
\   4. Location: Confirm that we are within a small "cone" of safe approach
\
\   5. Rotation: Confirm that the slot is less than 33.6 degrees off the
\      horizontal
\
\ Here's a further look at how these tests work.
\
\ 1. Check how friendly the station is
\ ------------------------------------
\ This is the easiest check to do. The station is hostile if bit 7 of byte #32
\ of the station's ship data is set, so all we do is fetch that byte and check
\ to see of it is negative. If it is, then the station is hostile, so docking
\ ends badly.
\
\ 2. Check the angle of approach
\ ------------------------------
\ The space station's ship data is in INWK. The nosev vector in byte #9 to
\ byte #14 is the station's forward-facing normal vector, and it's perpendicular
\ to the face containing the slot, pointing straight out into space out of the
\ docking slot. You can see this in the diagram on the left, which is a side-on
\ view of the station, with us approaching at a jaunty angle from the top-right,
\ with the docking slot on the top face of the station. You can imagine this
\ vector as a big stick, sticking out of the slot.

\
\ We want to check whether the angle t is too large, because if it is, we are
\ coming in at the wrong angle and will probably bounce off the front of the
\ space station. To find out the value of t, we need to look at the geometry
\ of this situation.
\
\ The station's nose vector has length 1, because it's a unit vector. We
\ actually store a 1 in a unit vector as &6000, because this means we don't
\ have to deal with fractions. We can also just consider the high byte of
\ this figure, so 1 has a high byte of 96 when we're talking about vectors
\ like the station's nose vector.
\
\ So the nose vector is a big stick, poking out of the slot, with a length of
\ 1 unit (stored as a high byte of 96 internally).
\
\ Now, if that vector was coming perpendicularly out of the screen towards us,
\ we would be on a perfect approach angle, the stick would be poking in our
\ face, and the length of the stick in our direction would be the full length
\ of 1, or 96. However, if our angle of approach is off by a bit, then the
\ nose vector won't be pointing straight at us, and the end of the stick will
\ be further away from us - less "in our face", if you like.
\
\ In other words, the end of the stick is less in our direction, or to put it
\ yet another way, it's not so far towards us along the z-axis, which goes in
\ and out of the screen.
\
\ Or, to put it mathematically, the z-coordinate of the end of the stick, or
\ nosev_z, is smaller when our approach angle is off. The docking routine uses
\ this method to see how well we are approaching the slot, by comparing nosev_z
\ with 214, so what does that mean?
\
\ We can draw a triangle showing this whole stick-slot situation, like this. The
\ left triangle is from the diagram above, while the triangle on the right is
\ the same triangle, rotated slightly to the left:

\          :     L                          \     v

\          + station                              + station
\
\ The stick is the left edge of each triangle, poking out of the slot at the
\ bottom, and the ship is at the top, looking down towards the slot. We know
\ that the right-hand edge of the triangle - the adjacent side - has length
\ nosev_z, while the hypotenuse is the length of the space station's vector, 1
\ (stored as 96). So we can do some trigonometry, like this, if we just
\ consider the high bytes of our vectors:
\
\   cos(t) = adjacent / hypotenuse
\          = nosev_z_hi / 96
\
\ so:
\
\   nosev_z_hi = 96 * cos(t)
\
\ We need our approach angle to be off by less than 26 degrees, so this
\ becomes the following, if we round down the result to an integer:
\
\   nosev_z_hi = 96 * cos(26)
\              = 86
\
\ So, we get this:
\
\   The angle of approach is less than 26 degrees if nosev_z_hi >= 86
\
\ There is one final twist, however, because we are approaching the slot head
\ on, the z-axis from our perspective points into the screen, so that means
\ the station's nose vector is coming out of the screen towards us, so it has
\ a negative z-coordinate. So the station's nose vector in this case is
\ actually in the reverse direction, so we need to reverse the check and set
\ the sign bit, to this. Setting bit 7 of 86 gives us 214, so we get this:
\
\   The angle of approach is less than 26 degrees if nosev_z_hi <= 214
\
\ And that's the check we make below to make sure our docking angle is correct.
\
\ 3. Heading in the right direction
\ ---------------------------------
\ Before we can work out whether we are facing towards the space station, we
\ need to get the vector from us to the space station. Once this is done, it's
\ an easy check to see whether the sign of the z-coordinate of that vector is
\ positive or negative. Negative means the space station is behind us, so if
\ that's the case, we're falling into the station backwards, which doesn't end
\ well.
\
\ 4. Cone of safe approach
\ ------------------------
\ This is similar to the angle-of-approach check, but where check 2 only looked
\ at the orientation of our ship, this check makes sure we are in the right
\ place in space. That place is within a cone that extends out from the slot
\ and into space, and we can check where we are in that cone by checking the
\ angle of the vector between our position and the space station.
\
\ 5. Horizontal docking slot
\ --------------------------
\ The space station is one of the ships with a non-standard orientation (see the
\ deep dive on "Orientation vectors" for details). Specifically, the roofv
\ vector points out of the side of the space station in a direction that is
\ parallel to the horizontal line of the slot.
\
\ As we are approaching the station and trying to dock, then, the roof vector
\ is pointing to the side when the slot is nice and horizontal. If we start to
\ veer away from the horizontal, the roof vector will start to tilt further up
\ or down, so instead of pointing to 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock, it will tilt
\ above or below.
\
\ As the vector tilts away from the horizontal, its x-coordinate component will
\ start to shrink, as the x-axis goes from right to left. So this test:
\
\   |roofv_x_hi| >= 80
\
\ makes sure that the slot is reasonably horizontal. Specifically, the maximum
\ angle we are allowed to be off the horizontal by is given by:
\
\   cos(t) = 80 / 96
\
\ which gives an angle of t = 33.6 degrees. So if we approach with the slot at
\ an angle of more than 33.6 degrees, we will fail to dock successfully.

\
\ Deep dive: Scheduling tasks with the main loop counter
\ ======================================================
\
\ Summary: How the main loop counter controls what we do and when we do it
\
\ References: MCNT
\
\ Elite's program flow is based around a main loop that starts iterating as soon
\ as you get past the title screen. At its simplest - when docked - the main
\ loop does little more than listening for function key presses and calling the
\ relevant routines for cargo, equipment, charts and so on, but out in space in
\ the midst of a frenetic battle for survival, things get an awful lot busier.
\
\ If this level of activity isn't controlled, then things can really start to
\ slow down on an 2MHz 8-bit CPU that's doing its best to keep up with Thargoids
\ and missiles and suns and 3D graphics and ship AI and in-flight messages and
\ complicated vector maths and all the other demands that a futuristic Cobra Mk
\ III simulator makes on the hardware. Elite does a great job of maintaining a
\ respectable frame rate amongst all this activity, and one of its coping
\ mechanisms is the main loop counter in MCNT.
\
\ The idea behind the main loop counter is simple: on any particular iteration
\ round the main loop, it lets the game decide whether or not to perform each
\ specific action, depending on the counter value. Some actions are vital and
\ have to be done on every iteration round the loop, so they just ignore the
\ value of MCNT, but some actions don't need such regular attention. The loop
\ counter lets us do what's important all of the time, while doing what's less
\ important (or more difficult) only some of the time.
\
\ Let's see how this works.
\
\ Using MCNT to control what we do...
\ -----------------------------------
\ The main loop counter is stored in location MCNT. It gets decremented every
\ time the main loop restarts, just after routine TT100 is entered. Some
\ routines set the counter to specific values to ensure certain actions will or
\ won't happen (see below), but for the most part the counter decrements from
\ 255 down to 0 and back up to 255 again.
\
\ At various points in the code, we check the counter value to determine what we
\ need to do. One way of doing this is to use a logical AND to implement a
\ modulo operation, as follows. Consider the following code:
\
\   LDA MCNT
\   AND #7
\   BNE skip
\
\   ... code gets run once every 8 iterations ...
\
\   .skip
\
\ In binary, 7 is %00000111, so we perform the skip if any of the three lowest
\ bits of MCNT are non-zero. In other words, we run the code only when the three
\ lowest bits are all zero, which happens once every 8 iterations. This is the
\ same as saying "do the action when MCNT mod 8 = 0".
\
\ In general, if n is a power of 2, we can use AND #n-1 to calculate modulo n,
\ so we could use AND #31 to do something every 32 iterations, for example.
\
\ Another approach is to calculate the modulo and then compare the value to a
\ fixed number, to spread operations out within a specific batch of iterations.
\ For example:
\
\   LDA MCNT
\   AND #31
\
\   CMP #10
\   BNE skip1
\
\   ... code gets run once at iteration 10 out of every 32 iterations ...
\
\   .skip1
\
\   CMP #20
\   BNE skip2
\
\   ... code gets run once at iteration 20 out of every 32 iterations ...
\
\   .skip2
\
\ There are some minor variations on the above in the game code, but the basic
\ approach is the same: check the counter and perform actions accordingly. Let's
\ take a look at how the main loop counter is used to determine what happens
\ when in the main loop's iterations.
\
\ ...and when we do it
\ --------------------
\ Here's a breakdown of all events that are dependent on the value of MCNT. The
\ counts are given within each iteration batch, so "every 4 iterations on count
\ 0/4" means we do the action when MCNT is 0, 4, 8, 12 and so on, while "every
\ 32 iterations on count 10/32" means we do it when MCNT is 10, 42, 74 and so
\ on.
\
\   * Every 4 iterations on count 0/4: Update the non-essential dashboard bar
\     indicators (i.e. everything except speed, pitch and roll, scanner and
\     compass, which update every iteration)
\
\   * Every 8 iterations on count 0/8: Regenerate ship energy and shields
\
\   * Every 8 iterations on counts 0-4 (2 ships) and 5-7 (1 ship): Apply tactics
\     to 1 or 2 ships per iteration, working through all 13 slots every 8
\     iterations
\
\   * Every 16 iterations on counts 0/16 and 8/16: If configured, flash the
\     dashboard dials on and off, with 8 iterations on, and 8 off
\
\   * Every 16 iterations on counts 0/16 to 12/16: Tidy one ship's orientation
\     vectors for 13 out every 16 iterations
\
\   * Every 32 iterations on count 0/32: Check whether we are near a space
\     station, and spawn one if we are
\
\   * Every 32 iterations on count 10/32: Calculate the ship's altitude above
\     the planet, and die if we crash land
\
\   * Every 32 iterations on count 10/32: If our energy is low, print "ENERGY
\     LOW" as an in-flight message and beep
\
\   * Every 32 iterations on count 20/32: Calculate the ship's altitude above
\     the sun, set the cabin temperature accordingly (and die if it's too hot),
\     and if we are scooping, add the relevant amount of fuel
\
\   * Every 256 iterations on count 0/256: Consider spawning a ship
\
\ Resetting the counter
\ ---------------------
\ The MCNT counter is reset in various ways, to affect the state of the various
\ actions it triggers:
\
\   * It gets set to 0 when we buy fuel, launch from a space station, arrive in
\     a new system, or launch an escape pod, so the main loop won't consider
\     spawning new ships for at least 256 iterations (as the counter will be
\     decremented to 255 as soon as the main loop is entered)
\
\   * It gets set to 1 after completing an in-system jump, so the next iteration
\     through the main loop will potentially spawn ships (as the counter will be
\     decremented to 0 as soon as the main loop is entered)
\
\   * It gets set to 255 while the death screen is showing, so nothing gets
\     spawned during the death sequence, and then it's set to 0 once it's
\     finished

\ Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\ ==============================
\
\ Summary: The three vectors that determine a ship's orientation in space
\
\ References: MVEIT (Part 1 of 9), INWK, K%, TIDY, MVS4, MVS5
\
\ Each ship in the Elite universe has its own set of three orientation vectors,
\ which determine its orientation in space. There are three different vectors -
\ nosev, roofv and sidev - with each of them pointing along one of the ship's
\ main axes, like this:
\
\   * nosev points forward out of the nose of the ship
\
\   * roofv points up out of the ship's sunroof... or it would if it had one
\
\   * sidev points out of the ship's right view
\
\ (Note that there are five ships that have slightly different orientations to
\ this standard model, namely Thargoids, Thargons, space stations, cargo
\ canisters and asteroids. These orientations are described below.)
\
\ It might help to think of these vectors from the point of view of the ship's
\ cockpit. From this perspective, the orientation vectors always look like this,
\ with our ship at the origin:
\
\   roofv
\   ^
\   |
\   |
\   |
\   |    nosev
\   |   /
\   |  /
\   | /
\   |/
\   +-----------------------> sidev
\
\ Every ship out there has its own set of orientation vectors, with nosev
\ pointing out of that ship's nose, roofv pointing out of that ship's roof, and
\ sidev out of that ship's right side. The orientation vectors are used in lots
\ of places, for example:
\
\   * When we draw the ship on screen, we take the shape as defined by its
\     blueprint, and rotate it so that it aligns with its orientation vectors,
\     so the ship we draw on screen points the right way
\
\   * If an enemy ship is firing its lasers at us, we use that ship's nosev
\     vector to work out whether it is pointing towards us, and therefore
\     whether it can hit us
\
\   * When enemy ships pitch or roll, we can apply these movements by rotating
\     their orientation vectors
\
\ Our ship doesn't have its own set of orientation vectors - at least, not
\ explicitly. This is because our own ship's orientation vectors always align
\ with the main coordinate axes: sidev aligns with the x-axis, which always
\ points to the right from the point of view of our cockpit, while roofv aligns
\ with the y-axis and points up, and nosev aligns with the z-axis, which always
\ points into the screen.
\
\ Storing the vectors in the ship data block
\ ------------------------------------------
\ The three vectors are stored in bytes #9-26 of the ship's data block, so when
\ we copy a ship's data into the internal workspace INWK, the vectors live in
\ INWK+9 to INWK+26. Each vector coordinate is stored as a 16-bit sign-magnitude
\ number, like this:
\
\           [ INWK(10 9)  ]           [ INWK(16 15) ]           [ INWK(22 21) ]
\   nosev = [ INWK(12 11) ]   roofv = [ INWK(18 17) ]   sidev = [ INWK(24 23) ]
\           [ INWK(14 13) ]           [ INWK(20 19) ]           [ INWK(26 25) ]
\
\ We can refer to these three vectors in various ways, such as these variations
\ for the nosev vector:
\
\   nosev = (nosev_x, nosev_y, nosev_z)
\
\         = [ nosev_x nosev_y nosev_z ]
\
\           [ nosev_x ]
\         = [ nosev_y ]
\           [ nosev_z ]
\
\           [ (nosev_x_hi nosev_x_lo) ]
\         = [ (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) ]
\           [ (nosev_z_hi nosev_z_lo) ]
\
\ Orthonormal vectors
\ -------------------
\ The three orientation vectors are orthonormal, which means they are orthogonal
\ (i.e. they are perpendicular to each other), and normal (i.e. each of the
\ vectors has length 1).
\
\ We can rotate a ship about its centre by rotating these vectors, as in the
\ MVS4 routine (see the deep dive on "Pitching and rolling" for more about
\ this). However, because we use the small angle approximation to rotate in
\ space, and it is not completely accurate, the three vectors tend to get a bit
\ stretched over time, so periodically we have to tidy the vectors with the TIDY
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.
\
\ Initialisation
\ --------------
\ When a new ship is spawned, its vectors are initialised in ZINF as follows:
\
\   sidev = (1,  0,  0)
\   roofv = (0,  1,  0)
\   nosev = (0,  0, -1)
\
\ So new ships are spawned facing out of the screen, as their nosev vectors
\ point in a negative direction along the z-axis, which is positive into the
\ screen and negative out of the screen.
\
\ Internally, we store a vector value of 1 as 96, to support fractional values,
\ and the orientation vectors are stored as 16-bit sign-magnitude numbers. 96 is
\ &60, and &60 with bit 7 set is &E0, so we store the above vectors like this:
\
\   sidev = (&6000, 0, 0)
\   roofv = (0, &6000, 0)
\   nosev = (0, 0, &E000)
\
\ so nosev_z_hi = &E0 = -96, sidev_x_hi = &60 = 96 and so on.
\
\ Rotation matrices and axes
\ --------------------------
\ Sometimes we might refer to the orientation vectors as a matrix, with sidev
\ as the first row, roofv as the second row, and nosev as the third row, like
\ this:
\
\   [ sidev_x sidev_y sidev_z ]
\   [ roofv_x roofv_y roofv_z ]
\   [ nosev_x nosev_y nosev_z ]
\
\ though generally we talk about the individual vectors, because that's easier
\ to understand. See the deep dive on "Calculating vertex coordinates" for an
\ example of the above matrix in use.
\
\ For the mathematically inclined, the three orientation vectors can be thought
\ of as axes that define the 3D coordinate space orientated around the other
\ ship - they form the basis for this space. To put it yet another way, the
\ matrix above is a rotation matrix that transforms the axes of our ship into
\ the axes of the other ship.
\
\ Finally, the orientation vectors define a left-handed universe, with the thumb
\ as roofv, index finger as nosev, and middle finger as sidev.
\
\ Non-standard orientations
\ -------------------------
\ The following ships don't have a standard orientation (all other ships follow
\ the logical nose-roof-side pattern).
\
\   * Thargoid mothership:
\
\     * nosev points out of one side of the mothership
\
\     * roofv points out of the other side of the mothership
\
\     * sidev points out of the roof of the mothership
\
\   * Thargon:
\
\     * nosev points out of the Thargon's nose
\
\     * roofv points out of the side of the Thargon
\
\     * sidev points out of the roof of the Thargon
\
\   * Space station:
\
\     * nosev points forward out of the docking slot
\
\     * roofv points out of the side of the space station in a direction that is
\       parallel to the horizontal line of the slot
\
\     * sidev points out of the side of the space station in a direction that is
\       perpendicular to the horizontal line of the slot
\
\   * Cargo canister:
\
\     * nosev points out of the side of the canister, avoiding the apexes of the
\       pentagonal cross-section and at right-angles to roofv
\
\     * roofv points out of the side of the canister, through one of the apexes
\       of the pentagonal cross-section
\
\     * sidev points out of one end of the canister
\
\ The asteroid also follows its own orientation, but I'm not even going to try
\ to describe which features appear to be the the nose, roof and side, as they
\ all just look like bumps to me.
\
\ One interesting (and presumably intentional) effect of the Thargoid and
\ Thargon orientations can be seen when they pitch and roll. A pitching Thargoid
\ actually spins like a traditional flying saucer (i.e. like a spinning top) as
\ its roofv vector points out of its side (though a rolling Thargoid tilts back
\ and forth as expected). When fighting Thargoids, you often find yourself
\ orientating your ship to get them vertically aligned in your sights, which is
\ because you can then track their sideways pitching with your own vertical
\ pitching movement. This is different to the other ships, which expose their
\ soft underbellies to your lasers when they try to pitch out of your way.
\
\ That's Thargoids for you. Different... and deadly.

\ Part 5 of the MVEIT routine is responsible for performing this act of seeming
\ omnipotence, and it does this by rotating the (x, y, z) coordinate of the
\ ship we are processing, by the pitch and roll angles alpha (roll) and beta
\ (pitch), so the ship moves as we pitch and roll.
\
\ It does this using the exact same rotation equations that MVS4 uses in part 7
\ to rotate the ship's orientation vectors (see the deep dive on "Pitching and
\ rolling" for details of the maths behind the following). But just as with
\ part 7, there is a twist, and yet again, the twist is all about Minsky.
\
\ The twist is that, this time, the pitch and roll calculations are done in a
\ mixed-up order. In MVS4, we do the roll calculations first:
\
\   y = y - alpha * x
\   x = x + alpha * y
\
\ and then we do the pitch calculations:
\
\   y = y - beta * z
\   z = z + beta * y
\
\ and because we use the updated y in the x and z calculations, we get to enjoy
\ a more accurate result because of the Minsky effect, like this:
\
\   x -> x + alpha * (y - alpha * x)
\   y -> y - alpha * x - beta * z
\   z -> z + beta * (y - alpha * x - beta * z)
\
\ The calculation used here is very similar, but we switch the order of the x
\ and z calculations, by doing these two first:
\
\   y = y - alpha * x
\   z = z + beta * y
\
\ and then these two:
\
\   y = y - beta * z
\   x = x + alpha * y
\
\ The result is this really complex set of transformations:
\
\   x -> x + alpha * (y - alpha * x - beta * (z + beta * (y - alpha * x)))
\   y -> y - alpha * x - beta * (z + beta * (y - alpha * x))
\   z -> z + beta * (y - alpha * x)
\
\ This is a pretty hard-to-follow variation on the classic Minsky equations
\ implemented in MVS4, but it still encapsulates the essence of the Minsky
\ approach, which is to use the updated values when calculating. It's just that
\ this time we use the updated values of both y and z in the calculation, and
\ that leads to a different result.
\
\ We implement this variation like this, using K2 to store the updated value of
\ Y as we progress through the above stages:
\
\   1. K2 = y - alpha * x
\   2. z = z + beta * K2
\   3. y = K2 - beta * z
\   4. x = x + alpha * y
\
\ We also discard the low bytes from the angle multiplications, so all of the
\ above multiplications get divided by 256. This effectively converts the values
\ of alpha and beta from their stored value ranges of 0 to 31 and 0 to 8 in
\ ALP1 and BET1 into the ranges 0 to 0.125 and 0 to 0.03125. These figures work
\ well as small angles in radians, which is why we can apply the small angle
\ approximation to them above.

\    Summary: Calculate (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
\ Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
\ by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
\ following:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
\ it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
\ routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
\ 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
\ sign of the delta.)
\
\ The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
\ is determined by the value of X.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
\
\   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:
\
\                         * X = 0 adds the delta to (x_lo, x_hi, x_sign)
\
\                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)
\
\                         * X = 6 adds the delta to (z_lo, z_hi, z_sign)

\
\ Deep dive: Pitching and rolling
\ ===============================
\
\ Summary: Applying our pitch and roll to another ship's orientation in space
\
\ References: MVS4
\
\ In order to understand the MVS4 routine, we need first to understand what it's
\ for, so consider our Cobra Mk III sitting in deep space, minding its own
\ business, when an enemy ship appears in the distance. Inside the little
\ bubble of universe that Elite creates to simulate this scenario, our ship is
\ at the origin (0, 0, 0), and the enemy ship has just popped into existence at
\ (x, y, z), where the x-axis is to our right, the y-axis is up, and the z-axis
\ is in the direction our Cobra is pointing in.
\
\ Of course, our first thought is to pitch and roll our Cobra to get the new
\ arrival firmly into the crosshairs, and in doing this the enemy ship will
\ appear to move in space, relative to us. For example, if we do a pitch by
\ pulling back on the joystick or pressing "X", this will pull the nose of our
\ Cobra Mk III up, and the point (x, y, z) will appear to move down in the sky
\ in front of us.
\
\ So this routine calculates the movement of the enemy ship in space when we
\ pitch and roll, as then the game can show the ship on-screen and work out
\ whether our lasers are pointing in the correct direction to unleash fiery
\ death on the pirate/cop/innocent trader in our sights.
\
\ Pitch and roll
\ --------------
\ To make it easier to work with the 3D rotations of pitching and rolling, we
\ break down the movement into two separate rotations, the roll and the pitch,
\ and we apply one of them first, and then the other (in Elite, we do the roll
\ first, and then the pitch).
\
\ So let's look at the first one: the roll. Imagine we're sitting in our
\ spaceship and do a roll to the right by pressing ">". From our perspective
\ this is the same as the universe doing a roll to the left, so if we're
\ looking out of the front of our ship, and there's a stationary enemy ship at
\ (x, y, z), then rolling by an angle of a will look something like this:
\
\   y
\
\   ^         (x´, y´, z´)
\   |       /
\   |      /    <-.
\   |     /       a`.
\   |    /          |
\   |   /
\   |  /              __ (x, y, z)
\   | /       __..--''
\   |/__..--''
\   +-----------------------> x
\
\ So the enemy ship will move from (x, y, z) to (x´, y´, z´) in our little
\ bubble of universe. Moreover, because the enemy ship is stationary, rolling
\ our ship won't change the enemy ship's z-coordinate - it will always be the
\ same distance in front of us, however far we roll. So we know that z´ = z,
\ but how do we calculate x´ and y´?
\
\ First, let's ditch the z-coordinate, as we know this doesn't change. This
\ leaves us with a 2D rotation to consider; we are effectively only interested
\ in what happens in the 2D plane at distance z in front of our ship (imagine a
\ cinema screen at distance z, and that's what we're about to draw graphs on).
\
\ Now, let's look at the triangle formed by the original (x, y) point:
\
\   ^
\   |
\   |
\   |
\   |
\   |
\   |         h       __ (x, y)
\   |         __..--''  |
\   | __..--''    t     | <------- y
\   +----------------------->
\        <---- x ---->
\
\ In this triangle, let's call the angle at the origin t and the hypotenuse h,
\ and we already know the adjacent side is x and the opposite side is y. If we
\ plug these into the equations for sine and cosine, we get:
\
\   cos t = adjacent / hypotenuse = x / h
\   sin t = opposite / hypotenuse = y / h
\
\ which gives us the following when we multiply both sides by h:
\
\   x = h * cos(t)
\   y = h * sin(t)
\
\ (We could use Pythagoras to calculate h from x and y, but we don't need to -
\ you'll see why in a minute.)
\
\ Now let's look at the 2D triangle formed by the new, post-roll (x´, y´)
\ point:
\
\   ^         (x´, y´)
\   |       /|
\   |      / |
\   |     /  |
\   |  h /   |
\   |   /    | <------- y´
\   |  /     |
\   | /      |
\   |/ t+a   |
\   +----------------------->
\   <-- x´ -->
\
\ In this triangle, the angle is now t + a (as we have rolled left by an angle
\ of a), the hypotenuse is still h (because we're rotating around the origin),
\ the adjacent is x´ and the opposite is y´. If we plug these into the
\ equations for sine and cosine, we get:
\
\  cos(t + a) = adjacent / hypotenuse = x´ / h
\  sin(t + a) = opposite / hypotenuse = y´ / h
\
\ which gives us the following when we multiply both sides by h:
\
\   x´ = h * cos(t + a)                                   (i)
\   y´ = h * sin(t + a)                                   (ii)
\
\ We can expand these using the standard trigonometric formulae for compound
\ angles, like this:
\
\   x´ = h * cos(t + a)                                   (i)
\      = h * (cos(t) * cos(a) - * sin(t) * sin(a))
\      = h * cos(t) * cos(a) - h * sin(t) * sin(a)        (iii)
\
\   y´ = h * sin(t + a)                                   (ii)
\      = h * (sin(t) * cos(a) + cos(t) * sin(a))
\      = h * sin(t) * cos(a) + h * cos(t) * sin(a)        (iv)
\
\ and finally we can substitute the values of x and y that we calculated from
\ the first triangle above:
\
\   x´ = h * cos(t) * cos(a) - h * sin(t) * sin(a)        (iii)
\      = x * cos(a) - y * sin(a)
\
\   y´ = h * sin(t) * cos(a) + h * cos(t) * sin(a)        (iv)
\      = y * cos(a) + x * sin(a)
\
\ So, to summarise, if we do a roll of angle a, then the ship at (x, y, z) will
\ move to (x´, y´, z´), where:
\
\   x´ = x * cos(a) - y * sin(a)
\   y´ = y * cos(a) + x * sin(a)
\   z´ = z
\
\ Transformation matrices
\ -----------------------
\ We can express the exact same thing in matrix form, like this:
\
\   [  cos(a)  sin(a)  0 ]     [ x ]     [ x * cos(a) + y * sin(a) ]
\   [ -sin(a)  cos(a)  0 ]  x  [ y ]  =  [ y * cos(a) - x * sin(a) ]
\   [    0       0     1 ]     [ z ]     [            z            ]
\
\ The matrix on the left is therefore the transformation matrix for rolling
\ through an angle a.
\
\ We can apply the exact same process to the pitch rotation, which gives us a
\ transformation matrix for pitching through an angle b, as follows:
\
\   [ 1    0        0    ]     [ x ]     [            x            ]
\   [ 0  cos(b)  -sin(b) ]  x  [ y ]  =  [ y * cos(b) - z * sin(a) ]
\   [ 0  sin(b)   cos(b) ]     [ z ]     [ y * sin(b) + z * cos(b) ]
\
\ Finally, we can multiply these two rotation matrices together to get a
\ transformation matrix that applies roll and then pitch in one go:
\
\   [       cos(a)           sin(a)         0    ]     [ x ]
\   [ -sin(a) * cos(b)  cos(a) * cos(b)  -sin(b) ]  x  [ y ]
\   [ -sin(a) * sin(b)  cos(a) * sin(b)   cos(b) ]     [ z ]
\
\ So, to move our enemy ship in space when we pitch and roll, we simply need
\ to do this matrix multiplication. In 6502 assembly language. In a very small
\ memory footprint. Oh, and it needs to be quick, too, because we're going to
\ be using this routine a lot. Got that?
\
\ Small angle approximation
\ -------------------------
\ Luckily we can simplify the maths considerably by applying the "small angle
\ approximation". This states that for small angles in radians, the following
\ approximations hold true:
\
\   sin a ~= a
\   cos a ~= 1 - (a^2 / 2) ~= 1
\   tan a ~= a
\
\ These approximations make sense when you look at the triangle geometry that
\ is used to show the ratios of trigonometry, and imagine what happens when the
\ angle gets small; for example, cosine is defined as the adjacent over the
\ hypotenuse, and as the angle tends to 0, the hypotenuse "hinges" down on top
\ of the adjacent, so it's intuitive that cos a tends to 1 for small angles.
\
\ The approximations above state that cos a approximates to 1 - (a^2 / 2), but
\ Elite actually uses cos a ~= 1 and corrects for the inaccuracy by regularly
\ calling the TIDY routine to. So dropping the small angle approximations into
\ our rotation calculation above gives the following, much simpler version:
\
\   [  1   a   0 ]     [ x ]     [    x + ay     ]
\   [ -a   1  -b ]  x  [ y ]  =  [ y - ax  - bz  ]
\   [ -ab  b   1 ]     [ z ]     [ z + b(y - ax) ]
\
\ So to move rotate a point (x, y, z) around the origin (the centre of our
\ ship) by the current pitch and roll angles (alpha and beta), we just need to
\ calculate these three relatively simple equations:
\
\   x -> x + alpha * y
\   y -> y - alpha * x - beta * z
\   z -> z + beta * (y - alpha * x)
\
\ There's a fascinating document on Ian Bell's Elite website that shows this
\ exact calculation, in the author's own handwritten notes for the game. You
\ can see it in the third image here:
\
\   http://www.elitehomepage.org/design/
\
\ just below the original design for the cockpit, before the iconic 3D scanner
\ was added (which is a whole other story...).
\
\ Minsky circles
\ --------------
\ So that's what this routine does... it transforms x, y and z when we roll and
\ pitch. But there is a twist. Let's write the transformation equations as you
\ might write them in code (and, indeed this is how the routine itself is
\ structured).
\
\ First, we do the roll calculations:
\
\   y = y - alpha * x
\   x = x + alpha * y
\
\ and then we do the pitch calculations:
\
\   y = y - beta * z
\   z = z + beta * y
\
\ At first glance this code looks the same as the matrix calculation above, but
\ then you notice that the value of y used in the calculations of x and z is not
\ the original value of y, but the updated value of y. In fact, the above code
\ actually does the following transformation of (x, y, z):
\
\   x -> x + alpha * (y - alpha * x)
\   y -> y - alpha * x - beta * z
\   z -> z + beta * (y - alpha * x - beta * z)
\
\ Oops, that isn't what we wanted to calculate... except this version turns out
\ to do a better job than our original matrix multiplication above. This new
\ version, where we reuse the updated y in the calculations of x and z instead
\ of the original y, was "invented by mistake when [Marvin Minsky] tried to save
\ one register in a display hack", and inadvertently discovered a way to rotate
\ points within a pretty good approximation of a circle without using complex
\ maths. The method appeared as item 149 in the 1972 HAKMEM memo, and if that
\ doesn't mean anything to you, see if you can take the time to look it up.
\ It's worth the effort if you're interested in this kind of thing (and you're
\ the one reading a commentary on 8-bit code from 1984, so I'm guessing this
\ might include you).
\
\ Anyway, the rotation in Minsky's method doesn't describe a perfect circle,
\ but instead it follows a slightly sheared ellipse, but that's close enough
\ for 8-bit space combat in 192 x 256 pixels. So, coming back to the Elite
\ source code, the MVS4 routine implements the rotation like this (shown
\ here for the nosev orientation vectors, i.e. nosev_x, nosev_y and nosev_z):
\
\ Roll calculations:
\
\   nosev_y = nosev_y - alpha * nosev_x_hi
\   nosev_x = nosev_x + alpha * nosev_y_hi
\
\ Pitch calculations:
\
\   nosev_y = nosev_y - beta * nosev_z_hi
\   nosev_z = nosev_z + beta * nosev_y_hi
\
\ And that's how we rotate a point around the origin by pitch alpha and roll
\ beta, using the small angle approximation to make the maths easier, and
\ incorporating the Minsky circle algorithm to make the rotation more stable.

\    Summary: Apply a 3.6 degree pitch or roll to an orientation vector
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The first vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   RAT2                The direction of the pitch or roll to perform, positive
\                       or negative (i.e. the sign of the roll or pitch counter
\                       in bit 7)

\
\ Deep dive: Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\ ================================================
\
\ Summary: How other ships manage to pitch and roll in space
\
\ References: MVS5
\
\ We can pitch and roll our ship by varying amounts, as shown by the dashboard's
\ DC and RL indicators, but enemy ships don't have such a luxury - it turns out
\ they can only orientate themselves at a fixed speed. Specifically, they can
\ only pitch or roll by a fixed amount each iteration of the main loop - by an
\ angle of 1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees.
\
\ This fixed rotation speed makes life simpler for the game code, not only
\ because the angle is small enough to apply the small angle approximation, but
\ also because 1/16 is a power of 2. Let's see how this helps by looking at the
\ calculation in MVS5 in more detail.
\
\ Fixed angle calculations
\ ------------------------
\ The MVS5 routine applies the same trigonometry as described in routine MVS4
\ (see the deep dive on "Rotating the universe" for details). In MVS5 we rotated
\ the ship's orientation vectors by our own pitch and roll, but this time the
\ angle is fixed at a very small 1/16 radians (around 3.6 degrees) so the maths
\ is rather simpler. If you refer to the documentation for MVS4, you can see
\ that the equations for rolling a point (x, y, z) through an angle a to
\ (x´, y´, z´) are:
\
\   x´ = x * cos(a) - y * sin(a)
\   y´ = y * cos(a) + x * sin(a)
\   z´ = z
\
\ In this case, angle a is fixed at 1/16 radians, so we can take the small angle
\ approximations described in MVS4, and reduce them like this:
\
\   sin a ~= a
\          = 1/16
\
\   cos a ~= 1 - (a * a) / 2
\          = 1 - (1/16 * 1/16) / 2
\          = 1 - (1/256) / 2
\          = 1 - 1/512
\
\ Plugging these into the above equations, we get:
\
\   x´ = x * cos(a) - y * sin(a)
\      = x * (1 - 1/512) - y / 16
\
\   y´ = y * cos(a) + x * sin(a)
\      = y * (1 - 1/512) + x / 16
\
\   z´ = z
\
\ so this is what routine MVS5 implements.
\
\ To clarify further, let's consider the example when X = 15 (roofv_x) and
\ Y = 21 (sidev_x), which applies roll to the ship. If we consider the
\ orientation vectors, this is how the three vectors look if we're sitting in
\ in the ship's cockpit:
\
\   roofv (points up out of the ship's sunroof...
\   ^       or it would if it had one)
\   |
\   |
\   |
\   |    nosev (points forward out of the ship's nose
\   |   /        and into the screen)
\   |  /
\   | /
\   |/
\   +-----------------------> sidev (points out of the
\                                    ship's right view)
\
\ If we are doing a roll, then the nosev vector won't change, but roofv and
\ sidev will rotate around, so let's just consider the x-y plane (i.e. the
\ screen) and ignore the z-axis. It looks like this when we roll to the left by
\ angle a, rotating roofv to roofv´ and sidev to sidev´:
\
\             roofv
\                ^
\   roofv´       |
\         \      |
\          \     |
\           \    |
\            \   |
\             \  |                 __ sidev´     <-.
\              \ |         __..--''                a`.
\               \| __..--''                          |
\                +-----------------------> sidev
\
\ Applying trigonometry to the above diagram, we get:
\
\   roofv´ = roofv * cos(a) - sidev * sin(a)
\
\   sidev´ = sidev * cos(a) + roofv * sin(a)
\
\ so calling MVS5 with X = 15 (roofv_x) and Y = 21 (sidev_x) and a negative
\ RAT2 (as the roll angle a is anticlockwise in our example), we get the
\ following if we do the calculation for the x coordinates in-place:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512) - sidev_x / 16
\
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512) + roofv_x / 16
\
\ Subsequent calls with X = 17, Y = 23 and X = 19, Y = 25 cover the y and z
\ coordinates, so that's exactly what the roll section of routine MVS5 does,
\ with the pitch section doing the same maths, but on roofv and nosev.

\
\ Deep dive: The local bubble of universe
\ =======================================
\
\ Summary: The data structures used to simulate the universe around our ship
\
\ References: UNIV, FRIN, K%, XX21
\
\ One of the most impressive aspects of Elite is how expansive the universe
\ feels. The eight galaxies and 2048 systems no doubt have something to do with
\ this, but while they might make you feel like nothing more than a pale blue
\ dot in the background of a cosmic snapshot, the experience of flying around in
\ system space is a lot more visceral. That feeling in the pit of your stomach
\ when a group of pirates pings into view on the scanner, while you're busy
\ surfing the sun's rays for precious fuel while trying not to boil the outer
\ hull into stardust... there's a real sense of being there, out in the black.
\ Clearly a 32K micro from the early 1980s can't actually be home to an entire
\ solar system, so how does Elite simulate things closer to home?
\
\ The answer is in the "local bubble of universe", which stores all the details
\ of our immediate vicinity, along with the major bodies in the current system.
\ The local bubble is made up of the following data structures:
\
\   * The ship slots at FRIN
\   * The ship data block lookup table at UNIV
\   * The ship data blocks at K%
\   * The ship blueprints at XX21
\
\ Using these, the local bubble can store details on up to 13 (NOSH + 1) ships,
\ including the planet, sun and space station. Note that to keep things simple,
\ we call any object in the vicinity a "ship", whether it's a ship, or a space
\ station, the planet, the sun, a missile, an escape pod, an asteroid or a
\ cargo canister.
\
\ Let's look at these structures in more detail.
\
\ The ship slots at FRIN
\ ----------------------
\ Each ship in our local bubble of universe has its own "ship slot" in the table
\ at FRIN. Ships get added to slots by the NWSHP routine, and when they get
\ killed or fly too far away to be in the bubble, they get removed from the
\ table by the KILLSHP routine, and the whole table gets shuffled down to close
\ up the gap. This means that the next free gap is always at the end of the
\ table, assuming it isn't full (if it is, NWSHP returns with a flag to say that
\ no new ship was created).
\
\ The local bubble always contains the planet, plus either the sun or the space
\ station (but not both). The first two slots are reserved for this purpose as
\ follows.
\
\ The first ship slot at location FRIN is always reserved for the planet. It
\ contains 128 or 130, depending on the type of planet:
\
\   * 128 for a planet with an equator and meridian
\
\   * 130 for a planet with a crater
\
\ The second ship slot at FRIN+1 is always reserved for the sun and the space
\ station. They can share the same slot because we only ever have one of them in
\ our local bubble of universe at any one time - the sun disappears when we
\ enter the space station's safe zone, and it reappears when we leave it again.
\ This slot always contains one of the following:
\
\   * 8 (#SST) for the space station
\
\   * 129 for the sun
\
\ Any actual ships in our local bubble start at slot FRIN+2. There can be up to
\ 11 ships in the local bubble, and for each of these, there's a slot containing
\ the ship type. Ship types correspond to the blueprint numbers in the lookup
\ table at XX21, and as this table has 13 entries, the ship type will be a value
\ from 1-13 (though this part of the slot table never contains an 8, as we have
\ already reserved the second ship slot at FRIN+1 for the space station). Some
\ ship types have corresponding configuration variables that make the source
\ code a bit easier to follow - such as #COPS for the Viper - but not all of
\ them do. There is also one ship, the Cobra Mk III, that comes in two flavours:
\ a ship type of 5 is a bounty hunting Cobra, while a ship type of 7 is a more
\ peaceful trader. Both ships use the same blueprint when drawn on-screen, but
\ their tactical behaviour is quite different.
\
\ The 13 ship types are as follows, along with the configuration variables where
\ they exist:
\
\   1.  Sidewinder
\   2.  Viper (COPS)
\   3.  Mamba
\   4.  Python
\   5.  Cobra Mk III bounty hunter
\   6.  Thargoid (THG)
\   7.  Cobra Mk III trader (CYL)
\   9.  Missile (MSL)
\   10. Asteroid (AST)
\   11. Cargo (OIL)
\   12. Thargon (TGL)
\   13. Escape pod (ESC)
\
\ If a ship slot is empty, it contains 0.
\
\ The ship data block lookup table at UNIV
\ ----------------------------------------
\ For each occupied ship slot in Fthe table at FRIN, there is a corresponding
\ address in the lookup table at UNIV that points to that ship's data block.
\ The ship data blocks are stored in the K% workspace, and the addresses in
\ UNIV map to the ship slots in FRIN just as you would expect:
\
\   * UNIV points to the ship data block for the planet in slot FRIN
\
\   * UNIV+1 points to the ship data block for the sun or space station in slot
\     FRIN+1
\
\   * UNIV+2 points to the ship data block for the ship in slot FRIN+2
\
\   * UNIV+3 points to the ship data block for the ship in slot FRIN+3
\
\ ...and so on up to UNIV+12. Because each ship data block is always the same
\ size (36 bytes), the addresses in the UNIV table are hard-coded and don't
\ change.
\
\ The ship data blocks at K%
\ --------------------------
\ As noted above, the local bubble of universe can contain up to 13 (NOSH + 1)
\ ships, one for each slot in FRIN and address in UNIV. Each of those ships has
\ its own ship data block of 36 (NI%) bytes that contains information such as
\ the ship's position in space, its speed, its rotation, its energy levels and
\ so on. It also contains a pointer to that ship's ship line heap which is
\ where we store details of all the lines that aee required to draw the ship
\ on-screen, so that it's easy to remove the ship from the screen by redrawing
\ the exact same shape again (see the deep dive on "Drawing ships" for more
\ details).
\
\ These 13 blocks of ship data live in the first 468 bytes of the workspace at
\ K% (&0900 to &0AD4), while the ship line heaps are stored in descending order
\ from the start of the WP workspace. This is the layout of the ship data blocks
\ and ship line heaps in memory, shown when we are in the process of adding a
\ new ship to the local bubble in the NWSHP routine:

\
\ If we want to update a ship's data, which we want to do when moving the ship
\ in space during the main flight loop, then instead of working with the data in
\ the K% workspace, we first copy the whole block to the INWK workspace. This
\ "inner workspace" is in zero page, where it is much quicker and more efficient
\ to access mempory locations. When we are done updating the ship's data, we
\ copy it back to the relevant location in K%, as pointed to by the UNIV table.
\
\ See the deep dive on "Ship data blocks" for details of the 36 bytes and the
\ information that they contain.
\
\ The ship blueprints at XX21
\ ---------------------------
\ Each ship type has an associated ship blueprint that contains fixed data about
\ that specific ship type, such as its maximum speed or the size of the target
\ area we need to hit with our lasers to cause damage. The blueprints also
\ contain data on the ship's vertices, faces and edges, which are used to draw
\ the ship on-screen.
\
\ The table at XX21 contains the blueprint addresses for the various ship types.
\ See the deep dive on "Ship blueprints" for more details of the blueprints and
\ the information that they contain.

\ Ready-made bytes for plotting one-pixel points in mode 5 (the bottom part of

\ details.
\
\ There is one extra row to support the use of CTWOS+1,X indexing in the CPIX2
\ routine. The extra row is a repeat of the first row, and saves us from having
\ to work out whether CTWOS+1+X needs to be wrapped around when drawing a
\ two-pixel dash that crosses from one character block into another. See CPIX2

\ Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\ =====================================
\
\ Summary: The main line-drawing algorithm used to draw non-horizontal lines
\
\ References: LOIN
\
\ Most of what you see in the space view in Elite is composed of straight lines.
\ The ships are drawn using wireframes that are made up of straight lines, the
\ planets are made from circles and arcs that consist of lots of small, straight
\ lines, and the sun is no more than a sequence of horizontal lines, drawn along
\ a vertical axis. Having a fast line-drawing algorithm is essential in a game
\ like Elite.
\
\ Horizontal lines are a special case and have their own optimised routine at
\ HLOIN, but all non-horizontal lines in Elite are drawn using Bresenham's line
\ algorithm. Let's look at how that works.
\
\ The core algorithm
\ ------------------
\ The basic idea is quite simple. Let's consider a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2,
\ Y2), where that line slopes down and right at a reasonably shallow angle, like
\ this:
\
\   (X1, Y1) ''-..__
\                   ''--..__
\                           ''--..__
\                                   ''--.._
\                                           (X2, Y2)
\
\ As we move along the line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2), let's say that we move
\ across by delta_x and down by delta_y, like this:
\
\
\            <---------- delta_x --------->
\
\   (X1, Y1) ''-..__                                    ^
\                   ''--..__                            | delta_y
\                           ''--..__                    |
\                                   ''--.._             v
\                                           (X2, Y2)
\
\ So we have the following:
\
\   * As we move along the line by delta_x in the x-direction, we move down by
\     delta_y in the y-direction.
\
\ If we divide each side of the triangle by delta_x, we also get the following:
\
\   * As we move along the line by 1 in the x-direction, we move down by
\     (delta_y / delta_x) in the y-direction.
\
\ This is the core of the algorithm: if we step along the x-axis, 1 pixel at a
\ time, then if we also move down by (delta_y / delta_x) in the y-direction and
\ plot a point each time, we'll have our line. In pseudo-code, it looks like
\ this:
\
\   function line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
\     delta_x = x2 - x1
\     delta_y = y2 - y1
\     y = y1
\     for x from x1 to x2
\       plot(x, y)
\       y = y + (delta_y / delta_x)
\
\ If our screen had an infinite resolution, then this would do nicely... but, of
\ course, it doesn't, so we need to refine this idea. Internally we still do the
\ same calculation for y, but when we come to plot the point with plot(x, y), we
\ need to convert y into an integer. We could just convert y to the nearest
\ integer each time, but working with floating point numbers is pretty slow, so
\ the algorithm speeds things up by using the concept of a "slope error".
\
\ We're drawing a pixel line, so each time we step along the x-axis by 1 pixel,
\ we have a choice of either staying where we are in the y-axis, or moving down
\ one line (i.e. incrementing y by 1). We can't increase y by fractions, so
\ instead, each time we step along the x-axis, we keep a running total of how
\ far we would step down in the y-axis if we weren't constrained by only being
\ able to move down by 1. In other words, we keep a tally of the (delta_y /
\ delta_x)'s that we would ideally be adding to y, until we know we've moved
\ onto the next line, at which point we add 1 to y. This tally is known as the
\ "slope error", as it's a running tally of the current error between our pixels
\ and the real slope of the line.
\
\ There's one final tweak, and that's starting our slope error tally at 0.5,
\ which denotes the centre of the starting pixel. So the final algorithm looks
\ like this:
\
\   function line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
\     delta_x = x2 - x1
\     delta_y = y2 - y1
\     slope_err = abs(delta_y / delta_x)
\     error = 0.5
\     y = y1
\     for x from x1 to x2
\       plot(x, y)
\       error = error + slope_err
\       if error >= 1.0 then
\         y = y + 1
\         error = error - 1.0
\
\ Implementing Bresenham in 8-bit integers
\ ----------------------------------------
\ You may have noticed that the algorithm above still uses real numbers. When we
\ actually use this approach in Elite, we multiply all the real numbers by 256,
\ so that 256 is equivalent to 1.0. We can now initialise error to 128, and
\ instead of checking whether error >= 1.0, we can check whether error is >=
\ 256, like this:
\
\   function line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
\     delta_x = x2 - x1
\     delta_y = y2 - y1
\     slope_err = abs(delta_y / delta_x)
\     error = 128
\     y = y1
\     for x = x1 to x2
\       plot(x, y)
\       error = error + slope_err
\       if error >= 256 then
\         y = y + 1
\         error = error - 256
\
\ There is one final improvement. If we use a single byte to store the error,
\ then error >= 256 is the same as saying "has the addition just overflowed", in
\ which case we don't need to subtract 256 as the byte will already have rolled
\ around to 0. So here is the final algorithm used in Elite:
\
\   function line(x1, y1, x2, y2)
\     delta_x = x2 - x1
\     delta_y = y2 - y1
\     slope_err = abs(delta_y / delta_x)
\     error = 128
\     y = y1
\     for x = x1 to x2
\       plot(x, y)
\       error = error + slope_err
\       if C flag is set then
\         y = y + 1
\
\ This is the algorithm that's implemented in part 4 of the LOIN routine, for
\ gently sloping lines that go right and down. It uses Q, S, X and Y as follows:
\
\   Q = |delta_y| / |delta_x|
\   S = 128
\   Y = Y1
\   for X = X1 to X2
\     plot(X, Y)
\     S = S + Q
\     if C flag set then
\       inc Y
\
\ The full LOIN routine implements the same basic algorithm multiple times,
\ tweaked to cater for all the other variations of sloping line (such as more
\ vertical lines that slope sharply up and to the left, for example). But the
\ same principles apply, just with different signs.
\
\ Also, it's worth noting that Elite doesn't plot the last pixel in any of its
\ lines. This is to prevent corners from disappearing; if you imagine us drawing
\ a triangle by drawing a line from point A to point B, then from B to C, and
\ then from C to A again, then if we plotted the end points, each of the
\ triangle's vertices (A, B and C) would be plotted twice, once as the start of
\ a line, and again as the end of the line. Normally this wouldn't be a problem,
\ but because Elite draws everything on-screen using EOR logic (so objects can
\ be drawn and then erased by simply drawing them again), this would mean the
\ corner points would disappear, and that would look very strange. So there is
\ also logic in the following to omit the last pixel from the line, in the same
\ way that HLOIN omits the final pixel from its lines too.
\
\ Summary of the routine
\ ----------------------
\ To help with understanding the 7 parts of the line-drawing routine, here's a
\ summary of what each part does.
\
\   1. Calculate delta_x, delta_y
\      Choose either parts 2-4 or parts 5-7
\
\ If the line is closer to being horizontal than vertical, we step right along
\ the x-axis:
\
\   2. Potentially swap coordinates so X1 < X2
\      Set up screen address variables
\      Calculate |delta_y| / |delta_x|
\      Choose either part 3 or part 4
\
\   3. The line is going right and up (no swap) or left and down (swap)
\      X1 < X2 and Y1-1 > Y2
\      Draw from (X1, Y1) at bottom left to (X2, Y2) at top right
\      If we swapped, don't plot (X1, Y1)
\
\   4. The line is going right and down (no swap) or left and up (swap)
\      X1 < X2 and Y1-1 <= Y2
\      Draw from (X1, Y1) at top left to (X2, Y2) at bottom right
\      If we didn't swap, skip plotting (X1, Y1)
\
\ If the line is closer to being vertical than horizontal, we step up along
\ the y-axis:
\
\   5. Potentially swap coordinates so Y1 >= Y2
\      Set up screen address variable
\      Calculate |delta_x| / |delta_y|
\      Choose either part 6 or part 7
\
\   6. The line is going up and left (no swap) or down and right (swap)
\      X1 < X2 and Y1 >= Y2
\      Draw from (X1, Y1) at bottom right to (X2, Y2) at top left
\      If we didn't swap, skip plotting (X1, Y1)
\
\   7. The line is going up and right (no swap) or down and left (swap)
\      X1 >= X2 and Y1 >= Y2
\      Draw from (X1, Y1) at bottom left to (X2, Y2) at top right
\      If we didn't swap, skip plotting (X1, Y1)

\
\ Deep dive: Drawing monochrome pixels in mode 4
\ ==============================================
\
\ Summary: Poking screen memory to display monochrome pixels in the space view
\
\ References: PIXEL, TWOS, TWOS2
\
\ Everything boils down to pixels in the end. Even the most complicated ship
\ battle, with ship hulls glinting in the glow of the distant sun and sparkling
\ clouds of explosive dust dissipating into the cold vacuum of space... even
\ this scene of destruction and mayhem is made up of pixels, each of them either
\ black or white. We are all made of stars, and the stars are all made of
\ pixels.
\
\ Clearly, then, plotting pixels is a vital part of simulating the universe, and
\ the space view in Elite - the monochrome mode 4 part - is designed to make the
\ process as efficient as possible. The mode definition is set up by the loader
\ code in elite-loader.asm, where the 6845 CRTC chip is programmed to show a
\ screen mode with exactly 256 pixels in each row. Each pixel takes up one bit
\ in the space view, so that means the top part of Elite's split-screen mode
\ consists of 192 rows of pixels, with 256 bits in in each row.
\
\ So can we just plot a pixel by setting that bit on the relevant row in screen
\ memory? Unfortunately not, as the way the BBC Micro stores its screen memory
\ isn't completely straightforward, and to understand Elite's drawing routines,
\ an understanding of this memory structure is essential.
\
\ Screen memory
\ -------------
\ First up, the simple part. Because mode 4 is a monochrome screen mode, each
\ pixel is represented by one bit (1 for white, 0 for black). It's more complex
\ for the four-colour mode 5 that's used for the dashboard portion of the
\ screen, but for mode 4 it's as simple as it gets.
\
\ However, screen memory is not laid out as you would expect. It isn't a simple
\ sequence of 256-bit lines, one for each horizontal pixel line, but instead
\ the screen is split into rows and columns. Each row is 8 pixels high, and
\ each column is 8 pixels wide, so the 192x256 space view has 24 rows and 32
\ columns. That 8x8 size is the same size as a standard BBC Micro text
\ character, so the screen memory is effectively split up into character rows
\ and columns (and it's no coincidence that these match the character layout
\ used in Elite, where XC and YC hold the location of the text cursor, with XC
\ in the range 0 to 32 and YC in the range 0 to 23).
\
\ The mode 4 screen starts in memory at &6000, and each character row takes up
\ 8 rows of 256 bits, or 256 bytes, so that means each character row takes up
\ one page of memory. So the first character row starts at &6000, the second
\ character row starts at &6100, and so on.
\
\ Each character row on the screen is laid out like this in memory, where each
\ digit (0, 1, 2 etc.) represents a pixel, or bit:
\
\         01234567 ->-.      ,------->- 01234567->-.
\                      |    |                       |

\
\ The left-hand half of the diagram displays one 8x8 character's worth of
\ pixels, while the right-hand half shows a second 8x8 character's worth, and
\ so on along the row, for 32 characters. Specifically, the diagram above would
\ produce the following pixels in the top-left corner of the screen:
\
\   0123456701234567
\   0123456701234567
\   0123456701234567
\   0123456701234567
\   0123456701234567
\   0123456701234567
\   0123456701234567
\   0123456701234567
\
\ So let's imagine we want to draw a 2x2 bit of stardust on the screen at pixel
\ location (7, 2) - where the origin (0, 0) is in the top-left corner - so that
\ the top-left corner of the screen looks like this:
\
\   ................
\   ................
\   .......XX.......
\   .......XX.......
\   ................
\   ................
\   ................
\   ................
\
\ Let's split this up to match the above diagram a bit more closely:
\
\   ........ ........
\   ........ ........
\   .......X X.......
\   .......X X.......
\   ........ ........
\   ........ ........
\   ........ ........
\   ........ ........
\
\ As this is the first screen row, the address of the top-left corner is &6000.
\ The first byte is the first row on the left, the second byte is the second
\ row, and so on, like this:
\
\   &6000 = ........    &6008 = ........
\   &6001 = ........    &6009 = ........
\   &6002 = .......X    &600A = X.......
\   &6003 = .......X    &600B = X.......
\   &6004 = ........    &600C = ........
\   &6005 = ........    &600D = ........
\   &6006 = ........    &600E = ........
\   &6007 = ........    &600F = ........
\
\ So you can see that if we want to draw our 2x2 bit of stardust, we need to do
\ the following:
\
\   Set &6002 = %00000001
\   Set &6003 = %00000001
\   Set &600A = %10000000
\   Set &600B = %10000000
\
\ Or, if we want to draw our stardust without obliterating anything that's
\ already on-screen in this area, we can use EOR logic, like this:
\
\   Set &6002 = ?&6002 EOR %00000001
\   Set &6003 = ?&6002 EOR %00000001
\   Set &600A = ?&6002 EOR %10000000
\   Set &600B = ?&6002 EOR %10000000
\
\ where ?&6002 denotes the current value of location &6002. Because of the way
\ EOR works:
\
\   0 EOR x = x
\   1 EOR x = NOT x
\
\ this means that the screen display will only change when we want to poke a
\ bit with value 1 into the screen memory (i.e. paint it white), and when we're
\ doing this, it will invert what's already on-screen. This not only means that
\ poking a 0 into the screen memory means "leave this pixel as it is", it also
\ means we can draw something on the screen, and then redraw the exact same
\ thing to remove it from the screen, which can be a lot more efficient than
\ clearing the whole screen and redrawing the whole thing every time something
\ moves.
\
\ (The downside of EOR screen logic is that when white pixels overlap, they go
\ black, but that's not a particularly big deal in space - and it also means
\ that things like in-flight messages show up as black when they overlap the
\ sun, without complex logic.)
\
\ Converting pixel coordinates to screen locations
\ ------------------------------------------------
\ Given the above, we clearly need a way of converting pixel coordinates like
\ (7, 2) into screen memory locations. There are two parts to this - first, we
\ need to find out which character block we need to write into, and second,
\ which pixel row and column within that character corresponds to the pixel we
\ want to paint.
\
\ The first step is pretty easy. The screen is split up into character rows and
\ columns, with 8 pixels per character in both directions, so we can simply
\ divide the pixel coordinates by 8 to get the character location. Let's look
\ at some examples:
\
\   (7,   2)     becomes   (0.875,  0.25)
\   (57,  82)    becomes   (7.125,  10.25)
\   (191, 255)   becomes   (23.875, 31.875)
\
\ So the first pixel is at (0.875, 0.25), which is the same as saying it's in
\ the first character block (0, 0), and is at position (0.875, 0.25) within
\ that character. For the second example, the pixel is inside character (7, 10)
\ and is at position (0.125, 0.25) within that character, and the third is in
\ character (23, 31) at (0.875, 0.875) inside the character.
\
\ We can now codify this. To get the character block that contains a specific
\ pixel, we can divide the coordinates by 8 and ignore any remainder to get the
\ result we want, which is what the div operator does. So:
\
\   (7,   2)     is in character block   (7   div 8,   2 div 8)   =   (0, 0)
\   (57,  82)    is in character block   (57  div 8,  82 div 8)   =   (7, 10)
\   (191, 255)   is in character block   (191 div 8, 255 div 8)   =   (23, 31)
\
\ We can do the div 8 operation really easily in assembly language, by shifting
\ right three times, so in assembly, we get this:
\
\   Pixel (x, y) is in the character block at (x >> 3, y >> 3)
\
\ Next, we can then use the remainder to work out where our pixel is within
\ this 8x8 character block. The remainder is given by the mod operator, so:
\
\   (7, 2)       is at pixel   (7   mod 8,   2 mod 8)   =   (7, 2)
\   (57, 82)     is at pixel   (57  mod 8,  82 mod 8)   =   (1, 2)
\   (191, 255)   is at pixel   (191 mod 8, 255 mod 8)   =   (7, 7)
\
\ We can do a mod 8 operation really easily in assembly language by simply
\ AND'ing with %111, so in assembly, we get this:
\
\   Pixel (x, y) is at position (x AND %111, y AND %111) within the character
\
\ And this is the algorithm that's implemented in this routine, though with a
\ small twist.
\
\ Poking bytes into screen addresses
\ ----------------------------------
\ To summarise, in order to paint pixel (x, y) on the screen, we need to update
\ this character block:
\
\   (x >> 3, y >> 3)
\
\ and this specific pixel within that character block:
\
\   (x AND %111, y AND %111)
\
\ As mentioned above, we can update this pixel by poking a byte into screen
\ memory, so now we need to work out which memory location we need to update,
\ and what to update it with.
\
\ We've already discussed how each character row takes up one page (256 bytes)
\ of memory in Elite's mode 4 screen, so we can work out the page of the
\ location we need to update by taking the y-coordinate of the character for
\ the page. So, if (SCH SC) is the 16-bit address of the byte that we need to
\ update in order to paint pixel (x, y) on the screen (i.e. SCH is the high byte
\ and SC is the low byte), then we know:
\
\   SCH = &60 + y >> 3
\
\ because the first character row takes up page &60 (screen memory starts at
\ &6000), and each character row takes up one page.
\
\ Next, within this page of memory, we want to update the character number x >>
\ 3. Each character takes up 8x8 pixels, which is 64 bits, or 8 bytes, so we
\ can calculate the memory location of where that character is stored in screen
\ memory by multiplying the character number by 8, like this:
\
\   The character starts at byte (x >> 3) * 8 within the row's page
\
\ Next, we know that the pixel we want to update within this block is on row (y
\ AND %111) in the character, and because there are 8 bits in each row (one
\ byte), this is also the byte offset of the start of that row within the
\ character block. So we also know this:
\
\   The pixel is in the character byte number (y AND %111)
\
\ So, to summarise, we know we need to update this byte in the row's memory
\ page:
\
\   (x >> 3) * 8 + (y AND %111)
\
\ The final question is what to poke into this byte.
\
\ The two TWOS tables
\ -------------------
\ So we know which byte to update, and we also know which bit to set within
\ that byte - it's bit number (x AND %111). We could always fetch that byte and
\ EOR it with 1 shifted by the relevant number of spaces, but Elite chooses a
\ slightly different approach, one which makes it easier for us to plot not only
\ individual pixels, but also two pixels and even blocks of four.
\
\ There are two tables of bytes, one at TWOS and the other at TWOS2, that
\ contain ready-made bytes for plotting one-pixel and two-pixel points. In each
\ table, the byte at offset X contains a byte that, when poked into a character
\ row, will plot a single-pixel at column X (for TWOS) or a two-pixel "dash" at
\ column X (for TWOS2). As one example, this is what's in the fourth entry from
\ each table (i.e. the entry at offset 3):
\
\   TWOS+3  = %00010000
\
\   TWOS2+3 = %00011000
\
\ This is the value we need to EOR with the byte we worked out above, where the
\ offset is the bit number we want to set, i.e. (x AND %111). Or to put it
\ another way, if we set the following:
\
\   SCH = &60 + y >> 3
\   SC = (x >> 3) * 8 + (y AND %111)
\   X = x AND %111
\
\ then we want to fetch this byte:
\
\   TWOS+X
\
\ and poke it here:
\
\   (SCH SC)
\
\ to set the pixel (x, y) on-screen. (Or, if we want to set two pixels at this
\ location, we can use TWOS2, and if we wants a 2x2 square of pixels setting,
\ we can do the same again on the row below.)
\
\ And that's the approach used below.

\ Deep dive: The ball line heap
\ =============================
\
\ Summary: How we remember the lines used to draw circles so they can be redrawn
\
\ References: BLINE, LSX2, LSY2, LSP, WPLS2
\
\ The planet, the sun and ships in our local bubble of universe are complicated
\ things, and we have to use an awful lot of maths to calculate their shapes
\ on-screen. Not surprisingly, all that maths takes up quite a bit of processor
\ time. We can remove shapes from the screen by drawing the same shapes again in
\ exactly the same place (which erases them because it's all done with EOR
\ logic), so if we can avoid having to repeat all those intensive calculations
\ for that second drawing, that would save a lot of time and effort.
\
\ Not surprisingly, Elite has a solution - three of them, to be precise. Instead
\ of repeating the calculations for the second drawing, Elite has a set of three
\ "line heaps" where all the drawing information gets stored, so it's a simple
\ process to redraw, and therefore erase, any shape on-screen.
\
\ There are three types of line heap used in Elite:
\
\   * The ball line heap, which is used by the BLINE routine when drawing
\     circles (as well as polygonal rings like the launch and hyperspace tunnel)
\
\   * The sun line heap, which is used by the SUN routine when drawing the sun
\     (see the deep dive on "Drawing the sun" for details)
\
\   * The ship line heap, one per ship in the local bubble of universe, which
\     is used by the LL9 routine when drawing ships (see the deep dive on
\     "Drawing ships" for details)
\
\ Here we take a look at the ball line heap that's stored at LSX2 and LSY2, and
\ with the pointer in LSP.
\
\ Drawing and storing circles with BLINE
\ --------------------------------------
\ We draw a circle by repeated calls to BLINE, passing the next point around the
\ circle with each subsequent call, until the circle (or half-circle) is drawn.
\
\ Calling the routine with a value of &FF in FLAG initialises the line heap and
\ stores the first point in memory rather than in the heap, so it's ready for
\ the second call to BLINE, which is when we actually have a segment to draw
\ and store in the line heap.
\
\ The routine keeps a tally of the points passed to it on each call, storing
\ them in the line heaps at LSX2 and LSY2, and using the line heap pointer
\ in LSP (which points to the end of the heap). It also keeps the point from
\ the previous call to BLINE in K5(3 2 1 0), so it can draw a segment between
\ the last point and this one.
\
\ If a line doesn't fit on-screen, then it isn't drawn or stored in the heap.
\ Instead a &FF marker is inserted into the LSY2 entry at the current position,
\ which indicates to the next call to BLINE that it should start a new segment.
\ In this way broken, non-continuous lines can still be stored in the line
\ heap.
\
\ Keeping the points in the line heap lets us quickly redraw the circle without
\ needing to regenerate all the points, so it is easy to remove the circle from
\ the screen by simply redrawing all the segments stored in the line heaps. This
\ is done in WPLS2.
\
\ How the LSX2 and LSY2 heaps are structured
\ ------------------------------------------
\ The ball line heap is stored in 78 bytes at LSX2 and another 78 bytes at LSY2.
\ The LSP variable points to the number of the first free entry at the end of
\ the heap, so LSP = 1 indicates that the heap is empty.
\
\ The first location at LSX2 has a special meaning:
\
\   * LSX2 = 0 indicates the line heap contains data
\   * LSX2 = &FF indicates the line heap is empty
\
\ Meanwhile, if a y-coordinate in LSY2 is &FF, then this means the next point in
\ the heap represents the start of a new segment, rather than a continuation
\ of the previous one. Specifically, this is the layout in the heap:
\
\   LSX2  ...      X1  X2 ...
\   LSY2  ... &FF  Y1  Y2 ...
\
\ The first entry in the table at LSY2 is always &FF, as the first point is
\ always the start of a segment, so the start of a non-empty line heap looks
\ like this:
\
\   LSX2  0    X1  X2  X3 ...
\   LSY2  &FF  Y1  Y2  Y3 ...
\
\ When a planet is plotted for the second time to remove it from screen, the
\ heaps are reset by setting LSP to 1 and inserting a &FF at the start of LSX2.
\ See WPLS2 for details.

\ =====================================
\
\ Summary: The algorithms behind the stardust particles in the front view
\
\ References: STARS1
\
\ The small particles of dust out there in space - which I've called "stardust"
\ in this commentary, though I'm not sure what the official term is - is an
\ essential way of making us feel like we are flying through space in our Cobra.
\ Pulling back on the joystick and watching the stardust fly down and backwards
\ is still a seriously immersive feeling. You really feel like those particles
\ are slamming into your windshield as you shoot through space and into the
\ ether.
\
\ The STARS1 routine looks after stardust in the front view. It is responsible
\ for moving the stardust towards us according to our speed (so the dust rushes
\ past us), and applying our current pitch and roll to each particle of dust, so
\ the stardust moves correctly when we steer our ship.
\
\ The STARS6 routine processes stardust in the rear view, and is essentially the
\ reverse of STARS1. Let's take a look at how STARS1 works.
\
\ Processing stardust
\ -------------------
\ The process in STARS1 breaks down into three stages:
\
\  * Moving the stardust towards us
\
\  * Applying roll to the stardust
\
\  * Applying pitch to the stardust
\
\ Let's look at these three stages in more detail. Throughout the calculations
\ below, we disregard the low bytes from the angle calculations, just like in
\ part 5 of MVEIT.
\
\ Note that each particle of stardust has its own (x, y, z) coordinate. Stardust
\ coordinates are not true 3D space coordinates - when stardust is drawn, the z
\ value is purely used to determine the size of the stardust dot that is
\ displayed, and that's it. The dot is drawn at screen coordinate (x, y), so
\ when thinking about stardust, we're really thinking about a 2D plane, with the
\ z-coordinate only being used when moving the stardust towards us, and when
\ determining how it should look.

\ Each of the coordinates is stored as 16-bit sign-magnitude value, as in
\ (x_hi x_lo) and (y_hi y_lo). The coordinates for the Y-th particle of stardust
\ are stored in (SX+Y SXL+Y), (SY+Y SYL+Y) and (SZ+Y SZL+Y) respectively. The
\ origin for stardust particles is the centre of the screen, at the crosshairs.
\
\ Moving the stardust towards us
\ ------------------------------
\ The following calculations move the stardust away from the centre of the
\ screen by a distance proportionate to our speed, so dust that is further away
\ from us (i.e. with a high value of z) moves by a smaller amount to create a
\ sense of perspective.
\
\ These are the calculations:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. z = z - speed * 64
\   3. y = y + |y_hi| * q
\   4. x = x + |x_hi| * q
\
\ We move the particle towards us by reducing the z-coordinate by the current
\ speed - that's the easy part. We then calculate a factor q that determines how
\ far we should move the stardust particle away from the centre point, and apply
\ that factor by multiplying the x and y screen coordinates by (1 + q), which
\ has the effect of making particles near the centre (small x and y) move less
\ than particles near the edges (high x and y).
\
\ Essentially, this is using the fact that when we project 3D (x, y, z)
\ coordinates onto a 2D screen, the calculation is essentially:
\
\   x_screen = x / z
\   y_screen = y / z
\
\ so if we reduce z (i.e. move the particle near to us) then the x and y screen
\ coordinates should increase by an inverse but proportional amount.
\
\ Applying roll to the stardust
\ -----------------------------
\ The following calculations apply the current roll angle alpha to the stardust:
\
\   5. y = y + alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x - alpha * y / 256
\
\ These are essentially the same as the roll equations from MVS4, which work
\ in the same way when projected onto the 2D screen, as we can ignore the z axis
\ when rolling.
\
\ Applying pitch to the stardust
\ ------------------------------
\ The following calculations apply the current pitch angle beta to the stardust:
\
\   7. x = x + 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y - beta * 256
\
\ The second one is essentially the same as the pitch equation from MVS4,
\ just applied to the y-coordinate projected into 2D (i.e. divided by z).
\
\ The first one, though, is still a bit of a mystery. Removing this part of the
\ calculation doesn't seem to affect the look of the stardust field, and with
\ the maximum magnitude of beta being 8, and y always being less than 120, the
\ maximum delta applied to x is:

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ See STARS1 for an explanation of the maths used in this routine. The
\ calculations are as follows:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. x = x - |x_hi| * q
\   3. y = y - |y_hi| * q
\   4. z = z + speed * 64
\
\   5. y = y - alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x + alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x - 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y + beta * 256

\ ===================================
\
\ Summary: How to print big decimal numbers with decimal points and padding
\
\ References: BPRNT
\
\ Elite prints out a lot of numbers, all of them in decimal (hexadecimal and
\ binary numbers are used internally, but we never see them displayed). The
\ BPRNT routine can print out numbers from 0.1 to 4,294,967,295 (32 set bits),
\ though as the highest figure in the game is the cash pot and that stores the
\ cash amount * 10, the highest figure BPRNT might ever be asked to display is
\ 429,496,729.5 - the biggest cash pot we can have.
\
\ Let's first look at the algorithm for printing decimal numbers, as all our
\ numbers are stored in binary, and then we'll look at the BPRNT implementation
\ of it.
\
\ Printing decimal numbers
\ ------------------------
\ The algorithm is relatively simple, but it looks fairly complicated because
\ we're dealing with 32-bit numbers.
\
\ To see how it works, let's first consider a simple example with fewer digits.
\ Let's say we want to print out the following number to three digits:
\
\   567
\
\ First we subtract 100 repeatedly until we can't do it any more, counting how
\ many times we can do this:
\
\   567 - 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 = 67
\
\ Not surprisingly, we can subtract it 5 times, so our first digit is 5. Now we
\ multiply the remaining number by 10 to get 670, and repeat the process:
\
\   670 - 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 = 70
\
\ We subtracted 100 6 times, so the second digit is 6. Now to multiply by 10
\ again to get 700 and repeat the process:
\
\   700 - 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 - 100 = 0
\
\ So the third digit is 7 and we are done.
\
\ The BPRNT routine
\ -----------------
\ The BPRNT subroutine does exactly this in its main loop at TT36, except that
\ instead of having a three-digit number and subtracting 100, we have up to an
\ 11-digit number and subtract 10 billion each time (as 10 billion has 11
\ digits), using 32-bit arithmetic and an overflow byte, and that's where
\ the complexity comes in.
\
\ Let's look at the above algorithm in more detail. We need to implement it with
\ multi-byte subtraction, which we can do byte-by-byte using the C flag, but we
\ also need to be able to multiply a multi-byte number by 10, which is slightly
\ trickier. Multiplying by 10 isn't directly supported the 6502, but multiplying
\ by 2 is, in the guise of shifting and rotating left, so we can do this to
\ multiply K by 10:
\
\   K * 10 = K * (2 + 8)
\          = (K * 2) + (K * 8)
\          = (K * 2) + (K * 2 * 2 * 2)
\
\ And that's essentially what we do in the TT35 subroutine, just with 32-bit
\ numbers with an 8-bit overflow. This doubling process is used quite a few
\ times in the following, so let's look at an example, in which we double the
\ number in K(S 0 1 2 3):
\
\   ASL K+3
\   ROL K+2
\   ROL K+1
\   ROL K
\   ROL S
\
\ First we use ASL K+3 to shift the least significant byte left (so bit 7 goes
\ to the C flag). Then we rotate the next most significant byte with ROL K+2 (so
\ the C flag goes into bit 0 and bit 7 goes into the C flag), and we repeat this
\ with each byte in turn, until we get to the overflow byte S. This has the
\ effect of shifting the entire five-byte number one place to the left, which
\ doubles it in-place.
\
\ Finally, there are three variables that are used as counters in the above
\ loop, each of which gets decremented as we go work our way through the
\ digits. Their starting values are:
\
\   XX17   The maximum number of characters to print in total (this is
\          hard-coded to 11)
\
\   T      The maximum number of digits that we might end up printing (11 if
\          there's no decimal point, 10 otherwise)
\
\   U      The loop number at which we should start printing digits or spaces
\          (calculated from the U argument to BPRNT)
\
\ We do the loop XX11 times, once for each character that we might print. We
\ start printing characters once we reach loop number U (at which point we
\ print a space if there isn't a digit at that point, otherwise we print the
\ calculated digit). As soon as we have printed our first digit we set T to 0
\ to indicate that we should print characters for all subsequent loops, so T is
\ effectively a flag for denoting that we're switching from spaces to zeroes
\ for zero values, and decrementing T ensures that we always have at least one
\ digit in the number, even if it's a zero.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\

\ or delete left (backspace).
\
\ WRCHV is set to point here by elite-loader.asm.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The character to be printed. Can be one of the
\                       following:

\                           punctuation)
\
\                         * 127 (delete the character to the left of the text
\                           cursor and move the cursor to the left)
\
\   XC                  Contains the text column to print at (the x-coordinate)
\
\   YC                  Contains the line number to print on (the y-coordinate)

                        \ do exactly the same to 64-95 and 96-125. And because

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Set A and X to the colours we should use for indicators showing dangerous and
\ safe values respectively. This enables us to implement flashing indicators,
\ which is one of the game's configurable options. If flashing is enabled, the
\ colour returned in A (dangerous values) will be red for 8 iterations of the
\ main loop, and yellow/white for the next 8, before going back to red. If we
\ always use PZW to decide which colours we should use when updating indicators,
\ flashing colours will be automatically taken care of for us.
\
\ The values returned are &F0 for yellow/white and &0F for red. These are mode 5
\ bytes that contain 4 pixels, with the colour of each pixel given in two bits,
\ the high bit from the first nibble (bits 4-7) and the low bit from the second
\ nibble (bits 0-3). So in &F0 each pixel is %10, or colour 2 (yellow or white,
\ depending on the dashboard palette), while in &0F each pixel is %01, or colour
\ 1 (red).
\
\ Returns:
\

\
\ Deep dive: The dashboard indicators
\ ===================================
\
\ Summary: How the bar-based dashboard indicators display their data
\
\ References: DILX, DIALS
\
\ The dashboard shows an awful lot of information, and the vast majority of the
\ indicators are bar-based (there are 11 bar indicators in all). The game uses
\ one routine to display all 11 of these indicators - routine DILX - and that
\ can lead to some interesting behaviour.
\
\ Each bar indicator is 16 pixels long, and the default entry point at DILX can
\ show values from 0-255, with each pixel in the bar representing 16 units (so
\ in the default mode, the last pixel, the 16th, is not used). For comparison,
\ if the routine is called via the entry point at DIL, then the bar's range is
\ 0-16, with each pixel representing 1 unit (and in this case, the 16th pixel
\ can be used).
\
\ The dashboard's bar-based indicators are as follows, along with the range of
\ values shown by the bar, plus the range of that particular measurement in the
\ game in brackets:
\
\   * Forward and aft shields   0-255
\   * Fuel                      0-64    (fuel is actually 0-70)
\   * Cabin temperature         0-255
\   * Laser temperature         0-255
\   * Altitude                  0-255
\   * Speed                     0-32    (speed is actually 0-40)
\   * Energy banks              0-16    (the first bank is actually 0-15)
\
\ Most of the indicators have internal values of 0-255 and use the standard DILX
\ bar (so, as noted above, they only use pixels 0-15 in the bar, and don't use
\ the last one).
\
\ The energy banks are the same, as the maximum value for the ship's energy
\ levels is 255, which is divided into four banks to give a range of 0-15 for
\ the first bank, and a range of 0-16 for the other banks. This means that when
\ the energy banks are fully charged, the top indicator doesn't use the last
\ pixel, while the other energy banks do.
\
\ As a result of the above, most of the indicators have a comfortable fit within
\ the dashboard, with an empty pixel at the end of the bar that gives a nice,
\ black gap between the left-hand indicators and the left edge of the scanner.
\ However, the maximum values for fuel and speed don't fit nicely into the space
\ available in their bar-based indicators. Here's why:
\
\   * The maximum value for fuel is 70 (for 7.0 light years), so when this
\     routine is called via DILX+2 to show the fuel reserves, the fuel
\     level in A is reduced down to a maximum of 17 (70 >> 2), which is one
\     bigger than the maximum of 16 that each bar can show. You never really
\     notice this as it's only the first 0.6 light years that fall off the end
\     of the bar, and jumps that small aren't that common, but the fuel level
\     does start off using all 16 pixels in its bar, which is one greater than
\     the other indicators in that column (all of which slot into the 0-15
\     pixel range), so it's clear that this indicator is slightly different.
\
\   * The speed indicator is at another level, though. The maximum speed of our
\     ship in Elite is a DELTA value of 40, which reduces down to an indicator
\     value of 20, four greater than the maximum value shown on the bar. The bar
\     simply cuts off any values greater than 16 and doesn't display the four
\     pixels that fall off the end. You can test this in-flight by tapping Space
\     until the speed indicator is just full, and then tapping it again four
\     times (during which your speed will still increase). If you then tap the
\     "?" key to slow down, you have to tap it five times before the speed
\     indicator starts to drop again. I guess there just wasn't room to let this
\     particular control knob go up to 11...
\
\ The only other dashboard indicators are the missile indicators, the pitch and
\ roll bars, the compass, the 3D scanner, and the space station and E.C.M.
\ bulbs, all of which have their own individual routines.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Palette bytes for use with the split-screen mode (see IRQ1 below for more
\ details).
\
\ Palette data is given as a set of bytes, with each byte mapping a logical
\ colour to a physical one. In each byte, the logical colour is given in bits
\ 4-7 and the physical colour in bits 0-3. See p.379 of the Advanced User Guide
\ for details of how palette mapping works, as in modes 4 and 5 we have to do
\ multiple palette commands to change the colours correctly, and the physical
\ colour value is EOR'd with 7, just to make things even more confusing.
\
\ Similarly, the palette at TVT1+16 is for the monochrome space view, where
\ logical colour 1 is mapped to physical colour 0 EOR 7 = 7 (white), and
\ logical colour 0 is mapped to physical colour 7 EOR 7 = 0 (black). Each of
\ these mappings requires six calls to SHEILA+&21 - see p.379 of the Advanced
\ User Guide for an explanation.
\
\ The mode 5 palette table has two blocks which overlap. The block used depends
\ on whether or not we have an escape pod fitted. The block at TVT1 is used for
\ the standard dashboard colours, while TVT1+8 is used for the dashboard when an
\ escape pod is fitted. The colours are as follows:

\

\

\
\ Deep dive: The split-screen mode
\ ================================
\
\ Summary: Elite's famous split-screen mode, dissected and explained in detail
\
\ References: IRQ1, B% (Loader)
\
\ Elite uses a unique split-screen mode that enables a high-resolution
\ black-and-white space view to coexist with a lower resolution, colour ship
\ dashboard. There are two parts to this screen mode: the custom mode, and the
\ split-screen aspect.
\
\ Elite's screen mode is a custom mode, based on mode 4 but with fewer pixels.
\ This mode is set up in elite-loader.asm by reprogramming the registers of the
\ 6845 CRTC - see the section on VDU command data at location B% for more
\ details, but the salient part is the screen size, which is 32 columns by 31
\ rows rather than the 40 x 32 of standard mode 4. Screen sizes are given in
\ terms of characters, which are 8 x 8 pixels, so this means Elite's custom
\ screen mode is 256 x 248 pixels, in monochrome.
\
\ The split-screen aspect is implemented using a timer. The timer is set when
\ the vertical sync occurs, which happens once every screen refresh. While the
\ screen is redrawn, the timer runs down, and it is set up to run out just as
\ the computer starts to redraw the dashboard section. When the timer hits zero
\ it generates an interrupt, which runs the code below to reprogram the Video
\ ULA to switch the number of colours per pixel from 2 (black and white) to 4,
\ so the dashboard can be shown in colour. The trick is setting up the timer so
\ that the interrupt happens at the right place during the screen refresh.
\
\ Looking at the code, you can see the SHEILA+&44 and &45 commands in LINSCN
\ start the 6522 System VIA T1 timer counting down from 14622 (the high byte is
\ 57, the low byte is 30). The authors almost certainly arrived at this exact
\ figure by getting close and then tweaking the result, as the vertical sync
\ doesn't quite happen when you would expect, but here's how they would have
\ got an initial figure to start working from.
\
\ First, we need to know more about the screen structure and exactly where the
\ vertical sync occurs. Looking at the 6845 registers for screen mode 4, we get
\ the following:
\
\   * The horizontal total register (R0) is set to 63, which means the total
\     number of character columns is 64, the same as the default for mode 4
\     (the number stored in R0 is the number of columns minus 1)
\
\   * The vertical total register (R4) is set to 38, which means the total
\     number of character rows is 39, the same as the default for mode 4 (the
\     number stored in R4 is the number of rows minus 1)
\
\   * The vertical displayed register (R6), which gives us the number of
\     character rows, is set to 31 in elite-loader.asm, a change from the
\     default value of 32 for mode 4
\
\   * The vertical sync position register (R7) is 34, which again is the
\     default for mode 4
\
\ For the countdown itself, we use the 6522 System VIA T1 timer, which ticks
\ away at 1 MHz, or 1 million times a second. Each screen row contains 64
\ characters, or 64 * 8 = 512 pixels, and in mode 4 pixels are written to the
\ screen at a rate of 1MHz, so that's 512 ticks of the timer per character row.
\
\ This means for every screen refresh, all 39 lines of it, the timer will tick
\ down from 39 * 512 = 19968 ticks. If we can work out how many ticks there are
\ between the vertical sync firing and the screen redraw reaching the
\ dashboard, we can use the T1 timer to switch the colour depth at the right
\ moment.
\
\ Register R7 determines the position of the vertical sync, and it's set to 34
\ for mode 4. In theory, this means that the vertical sync is fired when the
\ screen redraw hits row 34, though in practice the sync actually fires quite a
\ bit later, at around line 34.5.
\
\ It's probably easiest to visualise the screen layout in terms of rows, with
\ row 1 being the top of the screen:
\
\   1     First row of space view
\   .
\   .     ... 24 rows of space view = 192 pixel rows ...
\   .
\   24    Last row of space view
\   25    First row of dashboard
\   .
\   .     ... 7 rows of dashboard = 56 pixel rows ...
\   .
\   31    Last row of dashboard
\   .
\   .     ... vertical retrace period ...
\   .
\   34.5  Vertical sync fires
\   .
\   .     ... 4.5 rows between vertical sync and end of screen ...
\   .
\   39    Last row of screen
\
\ So starting at the vertical sync, we have 4.5 rows before the end of the
\ screen, and then 24 rows from the top of the screen down to the start of the
\ dashboard, so that's a total of 28.5 rows. So given that we have 512 ticks
\ per row, we get:
\
\   28.5 * 512 = 14592
\
\ So if we started our timer from 14592 at the vertical sync and let it tick
\ down to zero, then it should get there just as we reach the dashboard.
\
\ However, because of the way the interrupt system works, this needs a little
\ tweaking, which is where the low byte of the timer comes in. In the code
\ below, the low byte is set to 30, to give a total timer count of 14622.
\
\ (Interestingly, in the loading screen in elite-loader.asm, the T1 timer for
\ the split screen has 56 in the high byte, and 50 in the low byte, so it counts
\ down from 14386 instead of 14622. As a result the screen does flicker quite a
\ bit more at the top of the dashboard, and there are quite a few red and yellow
\ pixels above the split, as it switches a bit too early. Perhaps the authors
\ didn't think it worth spending time perfecting the loader's split screen? Who
\ knows...)

\    Summary: Apply tactics: Process missiles, both enemy missiles and our own
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This section implements missile tactics and is entered at TA18 from the main
\ entry point below, if the current ship is a missile. Specifically:
\
\   * If E.C.M. is active, destroy the missile
\
\   * If the missile is hostile towards us, then check how close it is. If it
\     hasn't reached us, jump to part 3 so it can streak towards us, otherwise
\     we've been hit, so process a large amount of damage to our ship
\
\   * Otherwise see how close the missile is to its target. If it has not yet
\     reached its target, give the target a chance to activate its E.C.M. if it
\     has one, otherwise jump to TA19 with K3 set to the vector from the target
\     to the missile
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is the space station, destroy
\     the missile, potentially damaging us if we are nearby
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is a ship, destroy the missile
\     and the ship, potentially damaging us if we are nearby
\

\
\ Deep dive: Program flow of the tactics routine
\ ==============================================
\
\ Summary: How ships and missiles work out attack patterns... or how to run away
\
\ References: TACTICS
\
\ Ships in Elite seem to have purpose - it's part of the reason why the Elite
\ universe feels so alive. Later versions of the game expand on the simpler
\ artificial intelligence in the BBC versions: the version of Elite for the
\ Acorn Archimedes is particularly celebrated for having ships that genuinely
\ seem to be going about their business, with busy lives of their own. But even
\ in the memory-constrained cassette version on the BBC Micro, the universe
\ feels as if it is piloted by real people... or real aliens, if you're unlucky
\ enough to bump into the Thargoids.
\
\ The heart of Elite's convincing AI is the TACTICS routine. This gets applied
\ to every ship that has bit 7 set in ship byte #32, and it is called by the
\ MVEIT routine, which itself is called on every iteration of the main loop.
\ However, because it takes quite a bit of time to apply tactics to a ship, they
\ are only applied to one or two ships on each iteration of the main flight
\ loop, depending on the value of the main loop counter in MCNT.
\
\ Program flow
\ ------------
\ Let's see how ships in Elite are brought to life by stepping through the
\ TACTICS routine. You might want to start with part 2, as that's where the main
\ entry point is (the following is in the order in which it appears in the
\ source code).
\
\ 1/7 TA34 (missile tactics, called from part 1 for missiles only)
\
\   * If E.C.M. is active, destroy the missile
\
\   * If the missile is hostile towards us, then check how close it is. If it
\     hasn't reached us, jump to part 3 so it can streak towards us, otherwise
\     we've been hit, so process a large amount of damage to our ship, which can
\     lead to DEATH
\
\   * Otherwise see how close the missile is to its target. If it has not yet
\     reached its target, give the target a chance to activate its E.C.M. if it
\     has one, otherwise jump to part 3
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is the space station, destroy
\     the missile, potentially damaging us if we are nearby
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is a ship, destroy the missile
\     and the ship, potentially damaging us if we are nearby
\
\ 2/7 TACTICS (main entry point for tactics)
\
\   * If this is a missile, jump up to the missile code in part 1
\
\   * If this is an escape pod, point it at the planet and jump to part 7
\
\   * If this is the space station and it is hostile, spawn a cop and we're done
\
\   * If this is a lone Thargon without a mothership, set it adrift aimlessly
\     and we're done
\
\   * If this is a pirate and we are within the space station safe zone, stop
\     the pirate from attacking
\
\   * Recharge the ship's energy banks by 1
\
\ 3/7
\
\   * Calculate the dot product of the ship's nose vector (i.e. the direction it
\     is pointing) with the vector between us and the ship so we can work out
\     later on whether the enemy ship can hit us with its lasers
\
\ 4/7
\
\   * Rarely (2.5% chance) roll the ship by a noticeable amount
\
\   * If the ship has at least half its energy banks full, jump to part 6 to
\     consider firing the lasers
\
\   * If the ship isn't really low on energy, jump to part 5 to consider firing
\     a missile
\
\   * Rarely (10% chance) the ship runs out of both energy and luck, and bails,
\     launching an escape pod and drifting in space
\
\ 5/7
\
\   * If the ship doesn't have any missiles, skip to the next part
\
\   * If an E.C.M. is firing, skip to the next part
\
\   * Randomly decide whether to fire a missile (or, in the case of Thargoids,
\     release a Thargon), and if we do, we're done
\
\ 6/7
\
\   * If the ship is not pointing at us, skip to the next part
\
\   * If the ship is pointing at us but not accurately, fire its laser at us and
\     skip to the next part
\
\   * If we are in the ship's crosshairs, register some damage to our ship, slow
\     down the attacking ship, make the noise of us being hit by laser fire
\     (which could end in DEATH), and we're done
\
\ 7/7
\
\   * Work out which direction the ship should be moving, depending on whether
\     it's an escape pod, where it is, which direction it is pointing, and how
\     aggressive it is
\
\   * Set the pitch and roll counters to head in that direction
\
\   * Speed up or slow down, depending on where the ship is in relation to us

\
\ Deep dive: In the crosshairs
\ ============================
\
\ Summary: How the game knows whether an enemy is being hit by our laser fire
\
\ References: HITCH
\
\ During combat, one of the most important calculations is working out whether
\ we have another ship in our sights. We need to calculate this when we're
\ trying to hit another ship with our lasers, and when we're trying to get the
\ enemy in our sights so we can lock a missile onto the target. In both cases,
\ we use the HITCH routine to work out just how close to the crosshairs that
\ ship really is. Let's take a look at how the HITCH routine works.
\
\ There are a number of steps we have to take to work out whether a ship is in
\ our crosshairs. They are as follows.
\
\   * Make sure the ship is in front of us (z_sign is positive)
\
\   * Make sure this isn't the planet or sun (bit 7 of the ship type is clear)
\
\   * Make sure the ship isn't exploding (bit 5 of byte #31 is clear)
\
\   * Make sure the ship is close enough to be targeted or hit (both x_hi and
\     y_hi are 0)
\
\   * Test whether our crosshairs are within the targetable area for this ship
\
\ This last one needs further explanation. Each ship type has, as part of its
\ blueprint, a 16-bits value that defines the area of the ship that can be
\ locked onto by a missile or hit by laser fire. The bigger this value, the
\ easier the ship is to hit.
\
\ The key to the calculation is the observation that the ship's x- and
\ y-coordinates give the horizontal and vertical distances between our line of
\ fire and the ship. This is because the z-axis points out of the nose of our
\ ship, and is therefore the same as our line of fire, so the other two axes
\ give the deviation of the other ship's position from this line.
\
\ We've already confirmed in the checks above that x_hi and y_hi are both zero,
\ so we calculate this:
\
\   (S R) = x_lo^2 + y_lo^2
\
\ which, using Pythagoras, is the same as the square of the distance from our
\ crosshairs to the ship.
\
\ If this calculation doesn't fit into the 16 bits of (S R) then we know we
\ can't be aiming at the ship, but if it does, we compare (S R) with the 16-bit
\ targetable area from the ship's blueprint, and if (S R) is less than the
\ targetable area, the ship is determined to be in our crosshairs and can
\ be hit or targeted.
\
\ So the targetable area is the square of the distance that the ship can be from
\ the centre of our crosshairs but still be locked onto by our missiles or hit
\ by our lasers.

\ again and draw a circle, and we keep doing this until the radius is bigger

\ initial circle of radius 9, then radius 10, all the way up to radius 15.

\
\ Deep dive: Stardust in the side views
\ =====================================
\
\ Summary: The algorithms behind the stardust particles in the side views
\
\ References: STARS2
\
\ The STARS2 routine moves the stardust sideways according to our speed and
\ which side we are looking out of, and applies our current pitch and roll to
\ each particle of dust, so the stardust moves correctly when we steer our ship.
\
\ Let's look at this process in more detail. It breaks down into three stages:
\
\  * Moving the stardust sideways
\
\  * Applying pitch to the stardust (rotating around the mid-point)
\
\  * Applying roll to the stardust (up and down)
\
\ Moving the stardust sideways
\ ----------------------------
\ First, we want to move the stardust sideways, in the correct direction for
\ the current view. The further away the stardust particle (i.e. with a higher
\ value of z) the slower it should move, to give a sense of perspective.
\
\ These are the calculations:
\
\   1. delta_x = 8 * 256 * speed / z_hi
\   2. x = x + delta_x
\
\ We sign the delta_x value as negative for the left view, where particles go
\ from right to left, and positive for the right view, where particles go from
\ left to right, and then we add the delta to the x-coordinate to move the
\ stardust particle past our side window as we speed along.
\
\ Applying pitch to the stardust (rotating)
\ -----------------------------------------
\ The following calculations apply the current pitch angle beta to the stardust:
\
\   3. x = x + beta * y
\   4. y = y - beta * x
\
\ These are essentially the same as the roll equations from MVS4, just using the
\ pitch angle beta, because when we are looking out of the side views, when the
\ ship pitches, the side views rotate around the middle, just like the front
\ view does when we roll.
\
\ Applying roll to the stardust (up/down)
\ ---------------------------------------
\ The following calculations apply the current roll angle alpha to the stardust:
\
\   5. x = x - alpha * x * y
\   6. y = y + alpha * y * y + alpha
\
\ The significant part here is adding alpha to y (or, more specifically, ALPHA *
\ 256). This means that as we roll the ship and alpha increases, the stardust
\ out of the side view goes up and down, which is pretty intuitive.
\
\ The other part is currently a bit of a mystery, along with the pitch
\ calculations in STARS1. More analysis needed here...

\
\ Deep dive: The sine, cosine and arctan tables
\ =============================================
\
\ Summary: The lookup tables used for the planet-drawing trigonometric functions
\
\ References: SNE, ARCTAN, ACT
\
\ The SNE table contains lookup values for sine and cosine. These values are
\ used when drawing circles and suns, as the small angle approximation that we
\ use when rotating ships in space isn't accurate enough for describing entire
\ circles. For this, we need to be able to look up the sine and cosine of any
\ angle, not just small ones, and for that we need a lookup table.
\
\ The ACT table, meanwhile, contains lookup values for arctan. This is used when
\ drawing the meridians and equators on planets in part 2 of PL9.
\
\ Let's have a look at how these tables work (see the deep dives on "Drawing
\ circles" and "Drawing the sun" for more details on how the sine and cosine
\ tables are actually used.)
\
\ Sine table
\ ----------
\ We use the sine table like this. To calculate the following:
\
\   sin(theta) * 256
\
\ where theta is in radians, we look up the value in:
\
\   SNE + (theta * 10)
\
\ Here's how this works. The value at byte number (theta * 10) is:
\
\   256 * ABS(SIN((theta * 10 / 64) * 2 * PI))
\
\ rounded to the nearest integer. If we expand the part that we pass to SIN():
\
\   (theta * 10 / 64) * 2 * PI =  (theta / 6.4) * 2 * PI
\                              =~ (theta / 6.4) * 6.28
\                              =~ theta
\
\ then substituting this into the above, we can see that the value at byte
\ (theta * 10) is approximately:
\
\   256 * ABS(SIN(theta))
\
\ Cosine table
\ ------------
\ So that's the sine lookup, but what about the cosine? To calculate the
\ following:
\
\   cos(theta) * 256
\
\ where theta is in radians, we look up the value in:
\
\   SNE + ((theta * 10) + 16) mod 32
\
\ How does this work? Well, because of the way sine and cosine work in terms of
\ right-angled triangles, the following holds true (using degrees for a second
\ as it's easier to picture):
\
\   cos(theta) = sin(90 − theta) = sin(90 + theta)
\
\ So to get the cosine value, we just need to look up the sine of 90 + theta.
\
\ The 32 entries in the sine table cover half a circle, as they go from sin(0)
\ to sin(31/64 * 2 * PI) and there are 2 * PI radians in a circle, so if 32
\ entries covers half a circle, 90 degrees is a half of that, or 16.
\
\ So to get the cosine, we look up the following value, applying mod 32 so the
\ table lookup wraps around correctly if the index falls over the end:
\
\   SNE + ((theta * 10) + 16) mod 32
\
\ It's not 100% accurate, but it's easily good enough for our needs.
\
\ Arctan table
\ ------------
\ To calculate the following:
\
\   theta = arctan(t)
\
\ where 0 <= t < 1, we look up the value in:
\
\   ACT + (t * 32)
\
\ The result will be an integer representing the angle in radians, with 256
\ representing a full circle of 2 * PI radians.
\
\ The ACT table contains arctan values for arguments less than one - in other
\ words, it contains values for arctan(0) through arctan(31/32), or angles
\ in triangles where the length of the opposite is less than the length of the
\ adjacent, so the angle is less than 45 degrees. This means the table contains
\ values in the range 0 to 31.
\
\ The table does not support values of t >= 1 or t < 0 directly, but we can use
\ the following calculations instead:
\
\   * For t > 1, arctan(t) = 64 - arctan(1 / t)
\
\   * For t < 0, arctan(-t) = 128 - arctan(t)
\
\ If t < -1, we can do the first one to get arctan(|t|), then the second to get
\ arctan(-|t|).
\
\ The first one follows from the fact that arctan(t) + arctan(1 / t) = PI / 2,
\ and we represent PI / 2 by 64 in our model.
\
\ The second one follows from the fact that arctan(-t) = PI - arctan(t) for the
\ range 0 < arctan(t) < PI, and we represent PI by 128 in our model.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following multiplication of an unsigned 16-bit number and an unsigned
\ 8-bit number:
\
\   (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\
\ where ~P means P EOR %11111111 (i.e. P with all its bits flipped). In other
\ words, if you wanted to calculate &1234 * &56, you would:
\
\   * Set A to &12
\   * Set P to &34 EOR %11111111 = &CB
\   * Set Q to &56
\
\ before calling MLTU2.
\
\ This routine is like a mash-up of MU11 and FMLTU. It uses part of FMLTU's
\ inverted argument trick to work out whether or not to do an addition, and like
\ MU11 it sets up a counter in X to extract bits from (P+1 P). But this time we
\ extract 16 bits from (P+1 P), so the result is a 24-bit number. The core of
\ the algorithm is still the shift-and-add approach explained in MULT1, just
\ with more bits.

\
\ Deep dive: Shift-and-add multiplication
\ =======================================
\
\ Summary: The main algorithm behind Elite's many multiplication routines
\
\ References: MULT1, MU11, FMLTU
\
\ Elite implements multiplication using the shift-and-add algorithm. One such
\ example is the MULT1 routine, which multiplies two 8-bit numbers to give a
\ 16-bit result). Let's take a look at how it does it, as this same technique is
\ used in lots of different multiplication routines throughout the game code.
\
\ Consider multiplying two example numbers, which we'll call p and a (as this
\ makes it easier to map the following explanation to the code in MULT1):
\
\   p * a = %00101001 * a
\
\ This is the same as:
\
\   p * a = (%00100000 + %00001000 + %00000001) * a
\
\ or:
\
\   p * a = %00100000 * a + %00001000 * a + %00000001 * a
\
\ or:
\
\   p * a = a << 5 + a << 3 + a << 0
\
\ or, to lay this out in the way we're used to seeing it in school books on
\ long multiplication, if a is made up of binary digits aaaaaaaa, it's the same
\ as:
\
\          00101001         p
\          aaaaaaaa x       * a
\   ---------------
\          aaaaaaaa
\         00000000
\        00000000
\       aaaaaaaa
\      00000000
\     aaaaaaaa
\    00000000
\   00000000        +
\   ---------------
\   xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx         -> the result of p * a
\
\ In other words, we can work our way through the digits in the first number p
\ and every time there's a 1, we add an a to the result, shifted to the left by
\ the position of that digit.
\
\ We could code this into assembly relatively easily, but Elite takes a rather
\ more optimised route. Instead of shifting the number aaaaaaaa to the left for
\ each addition, we can instead shift the entire result to the right, saving
\ the bit that falls off the right end, and add an unshifted value of a. If you
\ think of one of the sums in our longhand version like this:
\
\     a7a6a5a4a3a2a1a0
\   a7a6a5a4a3a2a1a0   +
\
\ then instead of shifting the second number to the left, we can shift the
\ first number to the right and save the rightmost bit, like this:
\
\     a7a6a5a4a3a2a1        -> result bit 0 is a0
\   a7a6a5a4a3a2a1a0 +
\
\ So the routine's approach is to work our way through the digits in the first
\ number p, shifting the result right every time and saving the rightmost bit
\ in the final result, and every time there's a 1 in p, we add another a to the
\ sum.
\
\ This is essentially what Elite does in the MULT1 routine, but there is one
\ more tweak that makes the process even more efficient (and even more
\ confusing, especially when you first read through the code). Instead of saving
\ the result bits out into a separate location, we can stick them onto the left
\ end of p, because every time we shift p to the right, we gain a spare bit on
\ the left end of p that we no longer use.
\
\ For a simpler version of the above algorithm, take a look at MU11, which
\ multiplies two unsigned numbers.
\
\ Optimised multiplication
\ ------------------------
\ The above approach is used in all the multiplication routines in Elite, though
\ sometimes it can be a bit hard to follow. Let look at a particularly knotty
\ example.
\
\ The FMLTU routine uses the same basic algorithm as MU11, but because we are
\ only interested in the high byte of the result, we can optimise away a few
\ instructions. Instead of having a loop counter to count the 8 bits in the
\ multiplication, we can instead invert one of the arguments (A in this case,
\ which we then store in P to pull bits off), and then reverse the logic so that
\ ones get skipped and zeroes cause an addition.
\
\ Also, when we do the first shift right, we can stick a one into bit 7, so we
\ can keep looping and shifting right until we run out of ones, which is an easy
\ BNE test. This works because we don't have to store the low byte of the result
\ anywhere, so we can just shift P to the right, rather than ROR'ing it as we do
\ in MULT1 - and that lets us do the BNE test, saving few precious instructions
\ in the process.
\
\ The result is a really slick, optimised multiplication routine that does a
\ specialised job, at the expense of clarity. To understand the FMLTU routine,
\ first try to understand MULT1, then look at MU11, and finally try FMLTU (I
\ have kept the comments similar so they are easier to compare). And if your
\ eyes aren't crossed by that point, then hats off to you, because this is
\ properly gnarly stuff.

\
\ Deep dive: Adding sign-magnitude numbers
\ ========================================
\
\ Summary: Doing basic arithmetic with sign-magnitude numbers
\
\ References: ADD
\
\ Elite uses a lot of sign-magnitude numbers, where the sign bit is stored
\ separately from an unsigned magnitude. The classic examples are the ship
\ coordinates at INWK, which are stored in 24 bits as as (x_sign x_hi x_lo),
\ where bit 7 of x_sign is the sign, and (x_hi x_lo) is the coordinate value.
\
\ This means that when we come to do arithmetic on sign-magnitude numbers, we
\ have to write our own routines for everything from addition and subtraction
\ to multiplication and division, as the standard two's complement maths that
\ the 6502 supports won't work.
\
\ For example, let's try adding 127 and -1 as sign-magnitude numbers, first
\ using sign-magnitude arithmetic. 127 is 01111111 as a sign-magnitude number,
\ while -1  is 10000001, and:
\
\   127 + -1 = 0 1111111 + 1 0000001
\            = 0 1111111 - 0 0000001
\            = 0 1111110
\            = 126
\
\ However, if we use the built-in ADC instruction, we get the following:
\
\   127 + -1 = 01111111 + 10000001
\            = 00000000
\
\ which is a completely different result.
\
\ Elite's ADD routine implements sign-magnitude addition using the following
\ algorithm. We want to add A and S, so:
\
\   * If both A and S are positive, just add them as normal
\
\   * If both A and S are negative, then add them and make sure the result is
\     negative
\
\   * If A and S have different signs, then we can use the absolute values of A
\     and S to work out the sum, as follows:
\
\     * Subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger absolute value
\
\     * Give the answer the same sign as the argument with the larger absolute
\       value
\
\ To see why this works, try visualising a number line containing the two
\ numbers A and S, with one to the left of zero and one to the right. Adding
\ the numbers is a bit like moving the number with the larger absolute value
\ towards zero on the number line, moving it by the amount of the smaller
\ absolute number; so it's like subtracting the smaller absolute value from the
\ larger one. You can also see that the sum of the two numbers will be on the
\ same side of zero as the number that is furthest from zero, so that's why the
\ answer should have the same sign as the argument with the larger absolute
\ value.
\
\ We can implement these steps like this:
\
\   * If |A| = |S|, then the result is 0
\
\   * If |A| > |S|, then the result is |A| - |S|, with the sign set to the same
\     sign as A
\
\   * If |S| > |A|, then the result is |S| - |A|, with the sign set to the same
\     sign as S
\
\ So that's what we do in the ADD routine to implement 16-bit sign-magnitude
\ addition. The same basic approach can be found in lots of Elite's arithmetic
\ routines: check the signs of the two operands, then add, subtract, divide or
\ multiply as appropriate, and finally set the sign bit correctly.

\ Deep dive: Flipping axes between space views
\ ============================================
\
\ Summary: Details of how the different space views are implemented
\
\ References: PLUT
\
\ Switching space views in Elite is one of those seemingly simple ideas that
\ ends up adding so much to the believability of the game universe. When you're
\ in deep space and an asteroid or a peaceful trader appears in the distance up
\ ahead, the ability to flick to the side view and then the rear view to watch
\ it speed past your windows is truly immersive; you really feel you're inside
\ a spaceship powering through space. And docking without being able to use the
\ side views to line up for your approach run? Forget it. Those space views are
\ an essential aspect of the game.
\
\ But do we really have to write four different display routines for the four
\ views? Luckily we don't, as the authors came up with a mathematical solution
\ that is both wonderfully elegant and extremely efficient. The solution is to
\ flip the axes for everything we want to display in the space view, so the axes
\ used in the drawing routines will still work.
\
\ The axis-flipping is quite q quick process. Indeed, there were originally six
\ views, with up and down thrown into the mix, but they ended up being dropped
\ to save space. It would only have taken a few extra instructions to implement
\ their flipped axes and stardust views, so the space would most likely have
\ been saved by removing the code supporting the extra laser mounts in the Equip
\ Ship screen).
\
\ Let's see what axis-flipping actually means.
\
\ Flipping the axes
\ -----------------
\ The solution to having multiple views is similar in concept to the way we
\ process pitch and roll. When we rotate our ship, we don't actually move our
\ ship at all - instead, we rotate the entire universe around us, in the
\ opposite direction to our movement (see the deep dives on "Pitching and
\ rolling" and "Rotating the universe" for more details on this process). We do
\ a similar kind of thing when we switch views, but instead of rotating all the
\ other ships and planets around us, we flip the axes instead, which is a much
\ quicker process.
\
\ How do we do this? First, we need to talk about the three axes. In terms of
\ our relationship to the universe, the z-axis always points into the screen,
\ the y-axis always points up, and the x-axis always points to the right, like
\ this:
\
\     y
\     ^
\     |   z (into screen)
\     |  /
\     | /
\     |/
\     +---------> x
\
\ This rule always applies, whichever view we are looking through. So when we're
\ looking through the front view, the z-axis is into the screen, which is also
\ the direction of travel - but if we switch to the left view, then the z-axis
\ is still into the screen, but the direction of travel is now to our right,
\ along the x-axis. So what was the z-axis is now the x-axis... so the axes just
\ flipped. That flipping process is essentially what the PLUT routine does.
\
\ It's important to note that the local universe is stored in the ship data
\ blocks at K% as if we are looking forward, so as far as the stored coordinates
\ are concerned, the z-axis is always in the direction of travel. As part of the
\ main flight loop, each ship data block is copied on turn into the INWK
\ workspace, where the movement routines in MVEIT are applied, before the block
\ is copied back into K% with the position of the ship updated.
\
\ It's after all the data has been copied back to K% that we start flipping
\ axes to fit the current space view, but this flipped version of the ship
\ doesn't get stored anywhere - the flipped data is only used for working out
\ missile and laser lock, and for drawing the ship, as these are the parts that
\ are affected by the view we're looking through.
\
\ Anyway, back to the process of flipping axes. If we are looking through the
\ front view then there is no flipping to be done, as the ship coordinates in
\ INWK are already using the correct axes, as mentioned above. If, however, we
\ are looking to the sides or rear, then the PLUT routine takes the ship
\ coordinates from INWK and switches the axes around, so that we can use the
\ same routines to display what's in that view.
\
\ For example, take the z-axis, which points into the screen for the front view.
\ We move it to point out of the screen if we are looking backwards, to the
\ right if we're looking out of the left view, or to the left if we are looking
\ out of the right view.
\
\ For the front view, then, we change nothing. Let's look at the other views in
\ more detail, because this is one of those concepts that makes a lot more sense
\ when you draw pretty diagrams.
\
\ Rear view
\ ---------
\ For the rear view, this is what our original universe axes look like when we
\ we are looking backwards:
\
\                 y
\                 ^
\                 |
\                 |
\                 |
\                 |
\     x <---------+
\                /
\               z (out of screen)
\
\ so to convert these axes into the standard "up, right, into-the-screen" set
\ of axes we need for drawing to the screen, we need to do the changes on the
\ left (with the original set of axes on the right for comparison):
\
\   y                                           y
\   ^                                           ^
\   |   -z (into screen)                        |   z (into screen)
\   |  /                                        |  /
\   | /                                         | /
\   |/                                          |/
\   +---------> -x                              +---------> x
\
\ So to change the INWK workspace from the original axes on the right to the
\ new set on the left, we need to change the signs of the x and z coordinates
\ and vectors in INWK, which we can do by flipping the signs of the following:
\
\   * x_sign, z_sign
\   * nosev_x_hi, nosev_z_hi
\   * roofv_x_hi, roofv_z_hi
\   * sidev_x_hi, sidev_z_hi
\
\ So this is what we do in the PLUT routine for the rear view.
\
\ Left view
\ ---------
\ For the left view, this is what our original universe axes look like when we
\ are looking to the left:
\
\       y
\       ^
\       |
\       |
\       |
\       |
\       +---------> z
\      /
\     /
\    /
\   x (out of screen)
\
\ so to convert these axes into the standard "up, right, into-the-screen" set
\ of axes we need for drawing to the screen, we need to do the changes on the
\ left (with the original set of axes on the right for comparison):
\
\   y                                           y
\   ^                                           ^
\   |   -x (into screen)                        |   z (into screen)
\   |  /                                        |  /
\   | /                                         | /
\   |/                                          |/
\   +---------> z                               +---------> x
\
\ In other words, to go from the original set of axes on the right to the new
\ set of axes on the left, we need to swap the x- and z-axes around, and flip
\ the sign of the one now going in and out of the screen (i.e. the new z-axis).
\ In other words, we swap the following values in INWK:
\
\   * x_lo and z_lo
\   * x_hi and z_hi
\   * x_sign and z_sign
\   * nosev_x_lo and nosev_z_lo
\   * roofv_x_lo and roofv_z_lo
\   * sidev_x_lo and sidev_z_lo
\
\ and then change the sign of the axis going in and out of the screen by
\ flipping the signs of the following:
\
\   * z_sign
\   * nosev_z_hi
\   * roofv_z_hi
\   * sidev_z_hi
\
\ So this is what we do in the PLUT routine for the left view.
\
\ Right view
\ ---------
\ For the right view, this is what our original universe axes look like when we
\ are looking to the right:
\
\               y
\               ^
\               |   x (into screen)
\               |  /
\               | /
\               |/
\   z <---------+
\
\ so to convert these axes into the standard "up, right, into-the-screen" set
\ of axes we need for drawing to the screen, we need to do the changes on the
\ left (with the original set of axes on the right for comparison):
\
\   y                                           y
\   ^                                           ^
\   |   x (into screen)                         |   z (into screen)
\   |  /                                        |  /
\   | /                                         | /
\   |/                                          |/
\   +---------> -z                              +---------> x
\
\ In other words, to go from the original set of axes on the right to the new
\ set of axes on the left, we need to swap the x- and z-axes around, and flip
\ the sign of the one now going to the right (i.e. the new x-axis). In other
\ words, we swap the following values in INWK:
\
\   * x_lo and z_lo
\   * x_hi and z_hi
\   * x_sign and z_sign
\   * nosev_x_lo and nosev_z_lo
\   * roofv_x_lo and roofv_z_lo
\   * sidev_x_lo and sidev_z_lo
\
\ and then change the sign of the axis going to the right by flipping the signs
\ of the following:
\
\   * x_sign
\   * nosev_x_hi
\   * roofv_x_hi
\   * sidev_x_hi
\
\ So this is what we do in the PLUT routine for the right view.

\ Deep dive: The 3D scanner
\ =========================
\
\ Summary: The maths behind Elite's famous 3D elliptical scanner
\
\ References: SCAN
\
\ The elliptical 3D scanner in the centre of the dashboard is one of Elite's
\ most celebrated features, but it almost didn't make it into the game. For
\ almost all of the game's life the scanner consisted of two two-dimensional
\ radars, one showing a top-down view of the area around the ship and the other
\ showing a side-on view, but it never really worked that well. Then, at the
\ very last minute, after the manual had been written and the game's code had
\ been polished until it shone, David Braben hit upon the idea of the 3D
\ ellipse, and it was so good it just had to go in, so while Braben created the
\ elliptical background image, Ian Bell coded it up, all in time to update the
\ manual and hit the publishing deadline.
\
\ It was worth the effort, as the scanner is a thing of beauty, not only in
\ terms of Braben's fantastic idea, which transforms the gaming experience, but
\ also in the elegant simplicity of Bell's code. This is the last bit of code
\ the pair wrote as anonymous undergraduates; after this, they would become rock
\ stars, and their worlds would change forever.
\
\ So how does it work, this spark of genius that is so essential in making the
\ 3D world of Elite feel so immersive? Well, to display a ship on the scanner,
\ there are six main hoops we have to jump through.
\
\ We start with the ship's coordinates in space, given relative to our position
\ (and therefore relative to the centre of the ellipse in the scanner, which
\ represents our ship). Let's call the other ship's coordinates (x, y, z), with
\ our position being at the origin (0, 0, 0).
\
\ We want to display a dot on the scanner at the ship's position, as well as a
\ stick that drops down (or rises up) from the dot onto the scanner's ellipse.
\
\ The steps we have to perform are as follows:
\
\   1. Check that the ship is within the scanner range (and stop if it isn't)
\
\   2. Set X1 = the screen x-coordinate of the ship's dot (and stick)
\
\   3. Set SC = the screen y-coordinate of the base of the ship's stick
\
\   4. Set A = the screen height of the ship's stick
\
\   5. Use these values to calculate Y1, the screen y-coordinate of the ship's
\      dot
\
\   6. Draw the dot at (X1, Y1) and draw a stick of length A from that dot (up
\      or down as appropriate)
\
\ Before looking at these steps individually, first we need to talk about the
\ scanner's dimensions.
\
\ Scanner dimensions
\ ------------------
\ In terms of screen coordinates, the scanner is laid out as follows.
\
\ The rectangle containing the scanner and compass has the following range of
\ screen coordinates inside the rectangle (so we definitely don't want to draw
\ anything outside these values, or the scanner will leak out into the
\ surrounding dashboard and space view):
\
\   * x-coordinate from  50 to 204
\   * y-coordinate from 193 to 246
\
\ The scanner's ellipse is 138 screen coordinates wide and 36 screen coordinates
\ high, and the range of coordinates is:
\
\   * x-coordinate from  56 to 192
\   * y-coordinate from 204 to 239
\
\ The centre of the scanner is at (124, 220).
\
\ That said, this routine restricts itself to a slightly smaller range when
\ passing coordinates to the drawing routines, only drawing dots and sticks
\ within this range:
\
\   * x-coordinate from  60 to 186
\   * y-coordinate from 194 to 246
\
\ These values are explained in the following.
\
\ Now that we know the screen area in which we are going to show our ships,
\ let's look at the different things we have to do.
\
\ Check the ship is in range
\ --------------------------
\ Elite does a simple check to see whether to show a ship on the scanner. Ship
\ coordinates are stored in the INWK workspace using three bytes, like this:
\
\   x = (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\   y = (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\   z = (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\ The sign bytes only use bit 7, so the actual value is in the high and low
\ bytes (these two bytes store the absolute value, without the sign).
\
\ A ship should be shown on the scanner if bits 7 and 6 of all the high bytes
\ are 0. This means that ships to be shown on the scanner have high bytes in the
\ range 0-63, as 63 = %00111111, and because the sign is kept separately, it
\ means that for ships that we show on the scanner, the following are true:
\
\   -63 <= x_hi <= 63
\   -63 <= y_hi <= 63
\   -63 <= z_hi <= 63
\
\ We can now move on to calculating the screen coordinates of the dot and stick.
\
\ Calculate the x-coordinate
\ --------------------------
\ The x-coordinate is the easiest, as all we have to do is scale x so that it
\ fits into the horizontal range of the scanner... and it turns out that the
\ range of (x_sign x_hi) is already pretty close to the full width of the
\ scanner (the ellipse is 138 screen coordinates wide, while the range of
\ (x_sign x_hi) values from -63 to +63 is 127, which is in the right ballpark).
\
\ So if we take the x-coordinate of the centre of the scanner, 124, and add
\ (x_sign x_hi), we get a range of 61 to 187, which fits nicely within the
\ ellipse range of 56 to 192 and is quick and easy to calculate.
\
\ There is one small tweak to this, however. If we add 124 to (x_sign x_hi),
\ then if the other ship is dead ahead of us - i.e. when (x_sign x_hi) = 0 - the
\ dot will be drawn with the left pixel on the centre line and the right pixel
\ just to the right of the line. This isn't a problem, but because we draw the
\ stick down (or up) from the right-hand pixel, this means that ships that are
\ dead ahead have a stick that lands on the ellipse just to the right of the
\ centre line. So to fix this, we actually add 123 to get the scanner
\ x-coordinate, as this not only moves the stick to the correct spot, it also
\ has the benefit of making the end-points even numbers, as the range of 123 +
\ (x_sign x_hi) is 60 to 186 (and even numbers are good news when your pixels
\ are always 2 screen coordinates wide).
\
\ So this is how we get the screen x-coordinate of the ship on the scanner:
\
\   X1 = 123 + (x_sign x_hi)
\
\ This was the easy one. Now for the y-coordinate of the base of the stick,
\ which is a bit more challenging.
\
\ Calculate the base of the stick
\ ---------------------------------
\ We already know the x-coordinate of dot, as we just calculated that, and the
\ stick will have the same x-coordinate as the dot, though we will add 1 when
\ drawing it, as the stick is on the right side of the 2-pixel-wide dot. So we
\ already know the x-coordinate of the base of the stick - now to find the
\ y-coordinate.
\
\ The main observation here is that the scanner's ellipse is a plane in space,
\ and for every point in that plane, the space y-coordinate is zero, and the
\ space x- and z-coordinates determine where those points appear, either from
\ left to right (for the x-axis) or front to back (the z-axis). We've already
\ worked out where the base of the stick is in terms of left and right, but what
\ about front to back?
\
\ If you think about it, points on the ellipse that are further in front of us
\ will be further up the screen, while those behind us will be lower down the
\ screen. It turns out that this is an easy way to work out the y-coordinate of
\ the base of the stick - we just take the space y-coordinate and scale it so
\ that it fits into the height of the ellipse on-screen. As long as we reverse
\ things so that large positive y-coordinates (far in front of us) are scaled to
\ smaller screen y-coordinates (higher up the screen), this should work pretty
\ well.
\
\ The maths for this is relatively simple. We take (z_sign z_hi), which is in
\ the range -63 to +63, divide it by 4 to get a range of -15 to +15, and then
\ negate it. We then add this to the coordinate of the centre of the ellipse,
\ which is at screen y-coordinate 220, to get the following:
\
\   SC = 220 - (z_sign z_hi) / 4
\
\ This is in the range 205 to 235, which is really close to the range of
\ y-coordinates of the ellipse on-screen (204 to 239), and fits within the
\ ellipse nicely.
\
\ Next, we need to work out the height of the stick, and then we'll have all the
\ information we need to draw this thing.
\
\ Convert the stick height
\ ------------------------
\ The stick height should be a signed number that contains the number of pixels
\ in the stick, with the sign set so that we can get the dot's y-coordinate by
\ adding the height to the y-coordinate of the base of the stick. This means
\ that we want the following to be true:
\
\   * The stick height should be negative for dots above the ellipse (as the dot
\     is above the base of the stick, so it has a lower y-coordinate)
\
\   * The stick height should be zero for dots on the ellipse
\
\   * The stick height should be positive for dots below the ellipse (as the dot
\     is below the base of the stick, so it has a lower y-coordinate)
\
\ The main observation here is that the length of the stick is effectively the
\ same as the ship's y-coordinate in space, just negated. Specifically:
\
\   * If the y-coordinate is 0, then the dot is in the plane of the ellipse and
\     there is no stick
\
\   * If the y-coordinate is positive, then the ship is above us and the stick
\     length should be negative
\
\   * If the y-coordinate is negative, then the ship is above us and the stick
\     length should be positive
\
\   * The further the ship is above or below us, the longer the stick
\
\ It turns out that it's good enough just to scale the y-coordinate to get the
\ stick length. Sure, if you were building an accurate scanner than the stick
\ length would also have to be scaled for reasons of perspective, but this is an
\ 8-bit space simulation from 1984 where every processor cycle counts, and the
\ following approximation is easily good enough.
\
\ It also turns out that dividing the y-coordinate by 2 does a good enough job.
\ We take (y_sign y_hi), which is in the range -63 to +63, and divide it by 2 to
\ get a range of -31 to +31. As we noted above, the y-coordinate for the base of
\ the stick is in the range 205 to 235, so this means the range of screen
\ y-coordinates for our dots comes out as 174 to 266.
\
\ But this is a bit of a problem - the dashboard only covers y-coordinates from
\ 193 to 246, so quite a few of the more distant dots will end up spilling out
\ of the dashboard if we don't do something about it. The solution is pretty
\ simple - if the dot is outside of the dashboard limits, we move it back
\ inside. This does mean that the dots and sticks of distant ships don't behave
\ correctly - they get shifted up or down to keep them within the dashboard,
\ which isn't correct - but somehow our brains don't seem to care. The stick
\ heights still remain correct, and the orientation of these outliers is still
\ generally in the right direction, so we can get away with this simplification.
\
\ In terms of this clipping, we actually clip the dot's y-coordinate so that it
\ is in the range 194 to 246, rather than 193 to 246. This is because the
\ double-height dot-drawing routine at CPIX2 takes the coordinate of the bottom
\ row of the dot, so we have to restrict it to a minimum of 194, as passing 193
\ would draw a dot that overlapped the top border of the dashboard.
\
\ So this is how we calculate the stick height from the ship's y-coordinate in
\ space:
\
\   A = - (y_sign y_hi) / 2
\
\ and clip the result so that it's in the range 193 to 246. So now we have all
\ the information required to draw the ship on the scanner, and to erase it
\ later (which we do by drawing it a second time).

\ Summary: How system data is extracted from the galaxy and system seeds
\
\ References: TT20, TT24, TT25, cpl, SOLAR, QQ15, QQ21
\
\ Famously, Elite's galaxy and system data is generated procedurally, using a
\ set of three 16-bit seed numbers and the Tribonnaci series. You can read all
\ about this process in the deep dives on "Generating system data", "Galaxy and
\ system seeds" and "Twisting the system seeds", as well as the galaxy
\ twisting process in Ghy.
\
\ The three seeds are stored as little-endian 16-bit numbers, so the low (least
\ significant) byte is first followed by the high (most significant) byte. That
\ means if the seeds are w0, w1 and w2, they are stored like this:
\
\       low byte  high byte
\   w0  QQ15      QQ15+1
\   w1  QQ15+2    QQ15+3
\   w2  QQ15+4    QQ15+5
\
\ In this documentation, we denote the low byte of w0 as w0_lo and the high byte
\ as w0_hi, and so on for w1_lo, w1_hi, w2_lo and w2_hi.
\
\ The seeds for the selected system are stored at QQ15, while the seeds for the
\ current galaxy are in QQ21.
\
\ Here's a summary of which bits in which seeds are used to generate the various
\ bits of data in the universe. The routine names where these data are generated
\ are shown at the end (TT25 etc.).

\ Deep dive: Twisting the system seeds
\ ====================================
\
\ Summary: How the system seeds are twisted to produce entire galaxies of stars
\
\ References: TT54, TT20, Ghy
\
\ Data on each star system in Elite's galaxies is generated procedurally, and
\ the core of this process is the set of three 16-bit seeds that describe each
\ system in the universe. Each of the eight galaxies in the game is generated in
\ the same way, by taking an initial set of seeds and "twisting" them to
\ generate 256 systems, one after the other.
\
\ Specifically, given the initial set of seeds, we can generate the next system
\ in the sequence by twisting that system's seeds four times. As we do these
\ twists, we can extract the system's data from the seed values - including the
\ system name, which is generated by the subroutine cpl, where you can read
\ about how this aspect works.
\
\ It is therefore no exaggeration that the twisting process implemented below
\ is the fundamental building block of Elite's "universe in a bottle" approach,
\ which enabled the authors to squeeze eight galaxies of 256 planets out of
\ nothing more than three initial numbers and a short twisting routine (and
\ they could have had far larger galaxies and many more of them, if they had
\ wanted, but they made the wise decision to limit the number). Let's look at
\ how this twisting process works.
\
\ The three seeds that describe a system represent three consecutive numbers in
\ a Tribonacci sequence, where each number is equal to the sum of the preceding
\ three numbers (the name is a play on Fibonacci sequence, in which each number
\ is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers). Twisting is the process of
\ moving along the sequence by one place. So, say our seeds currently point to
\ these numbers in the sequence:
\
\   0   0   1   1   2   4   7   13   24   44   ...
\                       ^   ^    ^
\
\ so they are 4, 7 and 13, then twisting would move them all along by one
\ place, like this:
\
\   0   0   1   1   2   4   7   13   24   44   ...
\                           ^    ^    ^
\
\ giving us 7, 13 and 24. To generalise this, if we start with seeds w0, w1
\ and w2 and we want to work out their new values after we perform a twist
\ (let's call the new values w0´, w1´ and w2´), then:
\
\   w0´ = w1
\   w1´ = w2
\   w2´ = w0 + w1 + w2
\
\ So given an existing set of seeds in w0, w1 and w2, we can get the new values
\ w0´, w1´ and w2´ simply by doing the above sums. And if we want to do the
\ above in-place without creating three new w´ variables, then we can do the
\ following:
\
\   tmp = w0 + w1
\   w0 = w1
\   w1 = w2
\   w2 = tmp + w1
\
\ In Elite, the numbers we're dealing with are two-byte, 16-bit numbers, and
\ because these 16-bit numbers can only hold values up to 65535, the sequence
\ wraps around at the end. But the maths is the same, it just has to be done
\ on 16-bit numbers, one byte at a time.
\
\ The seeds are stored as little-endian 16-bit numbers, so the low (least
\ significant) byte is first, followed by the high (most significant) byte.
\ Taking the case of the currently selected system, whose seeds are stored
\ in the six bytes from QQ15, that means our seed values are stored like this:
\
\       low byte  high byte
\   w0  QQ15      QQ15+1
\   w1  QQ15+2    QQ15+3
\   w2  QQ15+4    QQ15+5
\
\ If we denote the low byte of w0 as w0_lo and the high byte as w0_hi, then
\ the twist operation above can be rewritten for 16-bit values like this,
\ assuming the additions include the C flag:
\
\   tmp_lo = w0_lo + w1_lo          (tmp = w0 + w1)
\   tmp_hi = w0_hi + w1_hi
\   w0_lo  = w1_lo                  (w0 = w1)
\   w0_hi  = w1_hi
\   w1_lo  = w2_lo                  (w1 = w2)
\   w1_hi  = w2_hi
\   w2_lo  = tmp_lo + w1_lo         (w2 = tmp + w1)
\   w2_hi  = tmp_hi + w1_hi
\
\ And that's exactly what the TT54 subroutine does to twist our three 16-bit
\ seeds to the next values in the sequence, using X to store tmp_lo and Y to
\ store tmp_hi.
\
\ Twisting the galaxy seeds
\ -------------------------
\ The Ghy routine updates the galaxy seeds to point to the next galaxy. Using
\ a galactic hyperdrive rotates each seed byte to the left, rolling each byte
\ left within itself like this:
\
\   01234567 -> 12345670
\
\ to get the seeds for the next galaxy. So after 8 galactic jumps, the seeds
\ roll round to those of the first galaxy again.

\    Summary: Calculate system data from the system seeds
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate system data from the seeds in QQ15 and store them in the relevant
\ locations. Specifically, this routine calculates the following from the three
\ 16-bit seeds in QQ15 (using only w0_hi, w1_hi and w1_lo):
\
\   QQ3 = economy (0-7)
\   QQ4 = government (0-7)
\   QQ5 = technology level (0-14)
\   QQ6 = population * 10 (1-71)
\   QQ7 = productivity (96-62480)
\
\ The ranges of the various values are shown in brackets. Note that the radius
\ and type of inhabitant are calculated on-the-fly in the TT25 routine when
\ the system data gets displayed, so they aren't calculated here.

\
\ Deep dive: Generating system data
\ =================================
\
\ Summary: The algorithms behind the procedural generation of system data
\
\ References: TT24, TT25
\
\ The Data on System screen is, under the hood, a work of mathematical art.
\ Every bit of data on that screen is procedurally generated from the system
\ seeds, specifically from parts of w0_hi, w1_hi and w1_lo. For more details on
\ the system seeds see the deep dive on "Galaxy and system seeds".
\
\ The following bits of data are generated in routine TT24 and are stored in
\ locations QQ3 to QQ7:
\
\   QQ3 = economy (0-7)
\   QQ4 = government (0-7)
\   QQ5 = technology level (0-14)
\   QQ6 = population * 10 (1-71)
\   QQ7 = productivity (96-62480)
\
\ The species type and average radius aren't stored anywhere, but are generated
\ on-the-fly in routine TT25 when displaying the system data.
\
\ Let's look at how these bits of data are all generated.
\
\ Government
\ ----------
\ The government is given by a 3-bit value, taken from bits 3-5 of w1_lo. This
\ value determine the type of government as follows:
\
\   0 = Anarchy
\   1 = Feudal
\   2 = Multi-government
\   3 = Dictatorship
\   4 = Communist
\   5 = Confederacy
\   6 = Democracy
\   7 = Corporate State
\
\ The highest government value is 7 and the lowest is 0.
\
\ Economy
\ -------
\ The economy is given by a 3-bit value, taken from bits 0-2 of w0_hi. This
\ value determine the prosperity of the economy:
\
\   0 or 5 = %000 or %101 = Rich
\   1 or 6 = %001 or %110 = Average
\   2 or 7 = %010 or %111 = Poor
\   3 or 4 = %011 or %100 = Mainly
\
\ while bit 2 determines the type of economy:
\
\   bit 2 = %0 = Industrial
\   bit 2 = %1 = Agricultural
\
\ Putting these two together, we get:
\
\   0 = Rich Industrial
\   1 = Average Industrial
\   2 = Poor Industrial
\   3 = Mainly Industrial
\   4 = Mainly Agricultural
\   5 = Rich Agricultural
\   6 = Average Agricultural
\   7 = Poor Agricultural
\
\ If the government is an anarchy or feudal state, we need to fix the economy
\ so it can't be rich (as that wouldn't make sense). We do this by setting bit
\ 1 of the economy value, giving possible values of %010, %011, %110, %111.
\ Looking at the prosperity list above, we can see this forces the economy to
\ be poor, mainly, average, or poor respectively, so there's now a 50% chance
\ of the system being poor, a 25% chance of it being average, and a 25% chance
\ of it being "Mainly Agricultural" or "Mainly Industrial".
\
\ The highest economy value is 7 and the lowest is 0.
\
\ Technology level
\ ----------------
\ The tech level is calculated as follows:
\
\   flipped_economy + (w1_hi AND %11) + (government / 2)
\
\ where flipped_economy is the economy value with its bits inverted (keeping
\ it as a 3-bit value, so if the economy is %001, flipped_economy is %110). The
\ division is done using LSR and the addition uses ADC, so this rounds up the
\ division for odd-numbered government types.
\
\ Flipping the three economy bits gives the following spread of numbers:
\
\   7 or 2 = %111 or %010 = Rich
\   6 or 1 = %110 or %001 = Average
\   5 or 0 = %101 or %000 = Poor
\   4 or 3 = %100 or %011 = Mainly
\
\ This, on average, gives a higher number to rich states compared with poor
\ states, as well as giving higher values to industrial economies compared to
\ agricultural, all of which makes a reasonable basis for a measurement of
\ technology level.
\
\ The highest tech level is 7 + 3 + (7 / 2) = 14 (when rounded up) and the
\ lowest is 0.
\
\ Population
\ ----------
\ The population is calculated as follows:
\
\   (tech level * 4) + economy + government + 1
\
\ This means that systems with higher tech levels, better economies and more
\ stable governments have higher populations, with the tech level having the
\ most influence. The number stored is actually the population * 10 (in
\ billions), so we can display it to one decimal place by calling the pr2
\ subroutine (so if the population value is 52, it means 5.2 billion).
\
\ The highest population is 14 * 4 + 7 + 7 + 1 = 71 (7.1 billion) and the
\ lowest is 1 (0.1 billion).
\
\ Productivity
\ ------------
\ The productivity is calculated as follows:
\
\   (flipped_economy + 3) * (government + 4) * population * 8
\
\ Productivity is measured in millions of credits, so a productivity of 23740
\ would be displayed as "23740 M CR".
\
\ The highest productivity is 10 * 11 * 71 * 8 = 62480, while the lowest is 3 *
\ 4 * 1 * 8 = 96 (so the range is between 96 and 62480 million credits).
\
\ Species type
\ ------------
\ The species type is either Human Colonials, or it's an alien species that
\ consists of up to three adjectives and a species name (so you can get
\ anything from "Rodents" and "Fierce Frogs" to "Black Fat Felines" and "Small
\ Yellow Bony Lobsters").
\
\ As with the rest of the system data, the species is built from various bits
\ in the seeds. Specifically, all the bits in w2_hi are used, along with bits
\ 0-2 of w0_hi and w1_hi, and bit 7 of w2_lo.
\
\ First, we check bit 7 of w2_lo. If it is clear, print "Human Colonials" and
\ stop, otherwise this is an alien species, so we move onto the following
\ steps. (In the following steps, the potential range of the calculated value
\ of A is 0-7, and if a match isn't made, nothing is printed for that step.)
\
\   1. Set A = bits 2-4 of w2_hi
\
\     * If A = 0,  print "Large "
\     * If A = 1,  print "Fierce "
\     * If A = 2,  print "Small "
\
\   2. Set A = bits 5-7 of w2_hi
\
\     * If A = 0,  print "Green "
\     * If A = 1,  print "Red "
\     * If A = 2,  print "Yellow "
\     * If A = 3,  print "Blue "
\     * If A = 4,  print "Black "
\     * If A = 5,  print "Harmless "
\
\   3. Set A = bits 0-2 of (w0_hi EOR w1_hi)
\
\     * If A = 0,  print "Slimy "
\     * If A = 1,  print "Bug-Eyed "
\     * If A = 2,  print "Horned "
\     * If A = 3,  print "Bony "
\     * If A = 4,  print "Fat "
\     * If A = 5,  print "Furry "
\
\   4. Add bits 0-1 of w2_hi to A from step 3, and take bits 0-2 of the result
\
\     * If A = 0,  print "Rodents"
\     * If A = 1,  print "Frogs"
\     * If A = 2,  print "Lizards"
\     * If A = 3,  print "Lobsters"
\     * If A = 4,  print "Birds"
\     * If A = 5,  print "Humanoids"
\     * If A = 6,  print "Felines"
\     * If A = 7,  print "Insects"
\
\ So if we print an adjective at step 3, then the only options for the species
\ name are from A to A + 3 (because we add a 2-bit number) in step 4. So only
\ certain combinations are possible:
\
\   * Only rodents, frogs, lizards and lobsters can be slimy
\   * Only frogs, lizards, lobsters and birds can be bug-eyed
\   * Only lizards, lobsters, birds and humanoids can be horned
\   * Only lobsters, birds, humanoids and felines can be bony
\   * Only birds, humanoids, felines and insects can be fat
\   * Only humanoids, felines, insects and rodents can be furry
\
\ So however hard you look, you will never find slimy humanoids, bony insects,
\ fat rodents or furry frogs, which is probably for the best.
\
\ Average radius
\ --------------
\ The average radius is calculated as follows:
\
\   ((w2_hi AND %1111) + 11) * 256 + w1_hi
\
\ The highest average radius is (15 + 11) * 256 + 255 = 6911 km, and the lowest
\ is 11 * 256 = 2816 km.

\
\ Deep dive: Market item prices and availability
\ ==============================================
\
\ Summary: The algorithms behind the generation of each system's cargo market
\
\ References: TT151, AVL, GVL
\
\ The prices and availability of the market items on display in the Buy Cargo
\ screen are calculated using a couple of complex formulae, which take a base
\ value for each item, mix in a couple of economic variables, and blend it all
\ with a bit of random behaviour. The result is the heart of Elite's trading
\ system, where canny traders can make a killing (while the rest of us can't
\ seem to get a break).
\
\ Let's start by looking at the formula for prices, and then availability.
\
\ Market item prices
\ ------------------
\ This is the formula for an item's price, which is performed as an 8-bit
\ calculation:
\
\   price = (base_price + (random AND mask) + economy * economic_factor) * 4
\
\ The resulting price is 10 times the displayed price, so we can show it to one
\ decimal place. The individual items in the calculation are as follows:
\
\   * The item's base_price is byte #0 in the market prices table at QQ23, so
\     it's 19 for food, 20 for textiles, 235 for narcotics and so on.
\
\   * Each time we arrive in a new system, a random number is generated and
\     stored in location QQ26, and this is shown as "random" in the calculation
\     above.
\
\   * The item's mask is byte #3 in the market prices table at QQ23, so
\     it's &01 for food, &03 for textiles, &78 for narcotics and so on. The
\     more set bits there are in this mask, and the higher their position in
\     this byte, the larger the price fluctuations for this commodity, as the
\     random number is AND'd with the mask. So narcotics will vary wildly in
\     price, while food and textiles will be relatively stable.
\
\   * The economy for a system is given in a 3-bit value, from 0 to 7, that is
\     stored in QQ28. This value is described in more detail in routine TT24,
\     but this is the range of values:
\
\       0 = Rich Industrial
\       1 = Average Industrial
\       2 = Poor Industrial
\       3 = Mainly Industrial
\       4 = Mainly Agricultural
\       5 = Rich Agricultural
\       6 = Average Agricultural
\       7 = Poor Agricultural
\
\   * The economic_factor is stored in bits 0-4 of byte #1 in the market prices
\     table at QQ23, and its sign is in bit 7, so it's -2 for food, -1 for
\     textiles, +8 for narcotics and so on. Negative factors show products that
\     tend to be cheaper than average in agricultural economies but closer to
\     average in rich industrial ones, while positive factors are more
\     expensive in poor agricultural systems than rich industrial ones - so
\     food is cheaper in poor agricultural systems while narcotics are very
\     expensive, and it's the other way round in rich industrial systems,
\     where narcotics are closer to the average price, but food is pricier.
\
\   * The units for this item (i.e. tonnes, grams or kilograms) are given by
\     bits 5-6 of byte #1 in the market prices table at QQ23.
\
\ Market item availability
\ ------------------------
\ The availability of each item is also calculated using a formula, which is
\ again performed as an 8-bit calculation:
\
\   quantity = (base_quantity + (random AND mask) - economy * economic_factor)
\              mod 64
\
\ If the result of the above is less than 0, then the available quantity is set
\ to 0.
\
\ The item's base_availability is byte #2 in the market prices table at QQ23, so
\ it's 6 for food, 10 for textiles, 8 for narcotics and so on. The other
\ variables are described above.

\ Deep dive: Generating system names
\ ==================================
\
\ Summary: Producing system names from twisted seeds and two-letter tokens
\
\ References: cpl, QQ15, QQ16, QQ18, TT54
\
\ System names are generated from the three 16-bit seeds for that system. In
\ the case of the selected system, those seeds live at QQ15. The process works
\ as follows, where w0, w1, w2 are the seeds for the system in question
\
\   1. Check bit 6 of w0_lo. If it is set then we will generate four two-letter
\      pairs for the name (8 characters in total), otherwise we will generate
\      three pairs (6 characters).
\
\   2. Generate the first two letters by taking bits 0-4 of w2_hi. If this is
\      zero, jump to the next step, otherwise we have a number in the range
\      1-31. Add 128 to get a number in the range 129-159, and convert this to
\      a two-letter token (see variable QQ18 for more on two-letter tokens).
\
\   3. Twist the seeds by calling TT54 and repeat the previous step, until we
\      have processed three or four pairs, depending on step 1.
\
\ One final note. As the process above involves twisting the seeds three or
\ four times, they will be changed, so we also need to back up the original
\ seeds before starting the above process, and restore them afterwards.

\    Summary: Print a recursive token
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine works its way through the recursive tokens that are stored in
\ tokenised form in memory at &0400 to &06FF, and when it finds token number A,
\ it prints it. Tokens are null-terminated in memory and fill three pages,
\ but there is no lookup table as that would consume too much memory, so the
\ only way to find the correct token is to start at the beginning and look
\ through the table byte by byte, counting tokens as we go until we are in the
\ right place. This approach might not be terribly speed efficient, but it is
\ certainly memory-efficient.
\
\ For details of the tokenisation system, see variable QQ18.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The recursive token to be printed, in the range 0-148
\
\ Other entry points:

\ Deep dive: Drawing explosion clouds
\ ===================================
\
\ Summary: Drawing and storing explosion clouds for ships whose luck runs out...
\
\ References: DOEXP
\
\ Like the ships, planet and sun, explosion clouds take a lot of maths to draw,
\ and like them, we store the results of all this maths in a heap. For explosion
\ clouds, we use the same ship line heap that we use for lines, but instead of
\ storing lines on the ship line heap, we store details of the ship's explosion
\ cloud on the heap. (We can use the same space as a ship is either a wireframe
\ or an explosion cloud, but is never both.)
\
\ This is the heap structure:
\
\   * Byte #0 = cloud size
\
\   * Byte #1 = cloud counter, starts at 18, increases by 4 each time we redraw
\     the cloud, cloud expands until 128, shrinks until it overflows, then the
\     cloud disappears
\
\   * Byte #2 = explosion count for this ship from the blueprint (i.e. the
\     number of vertices used as origins for explosion clouds)
\
\   * Bytes #3 to #6 = random seeds to pass to DORND2 at the start of the
\     drawing process, so we can redraw the exact same cloud again
\
\   * Byte #7 onwards = coordinates of the visible vertices for the exploding
\     ship, so we can generate clouds around them (or, specifically, if byte #2
\     is n, the first n of them)
\
\ The block above is set up when a ship explodes, in place of the ship lines
\ themselves, as exploding ships don't have any lines any more.
\
\ The process for drawing explosion clouds is as follows:
\
\   * Redraw the existing explosion cloud, if there is one, to remove it from
\     the screen
\
\   * Increase the cloud counter by 4 (it starts at 18 for new explosions)
\
\   * Set the cloud size to cloud counter / distance, so the further away the
\     cloud, the smaller it is, and as the cloud counter ticks onward, the cloud
\     expands
\
\   * Use the cloud counter to determine the number of particles in each vertex
\     cloud, so the cloud has more particles as the counter increases, until it
\     gets past 128, after which the number decreases
\
\   * For the first n vertices (where n is the explosion count from the ship's
\     blueprint), do the following:
\
\     * Fetch the vertex coordinates from the XX3 workspace into the ship line
\       heap
\
\     * Seed the random number generator with four bytes from the ship line heap
\
\     * Plot randomly placed points within the radius of the vertex, with the
\       number of particles set above, with random sizes

\
\ Deep dive: Drawing colour pixels in mode 5
\ ==========================================
\
\ Summary: Poking screen memory to display colour pixels in the dashboard view
\
\ References: CPIX2, CTWOS
\
\ Drawing four-colour pixels in the dashboard is not as straightforward as you
\ might think. It's complicated enough drawing monochrome pixels in the
\ two-colour mode 4 screen that Elite uses for the space view, but it's even
\ more mind-bending in mode 5, so before you read the following, I highly
\ recommend you take a look at the deep dive on "Drawing monochrome pixels in
\ mode 4", which looks at screen addresses and plotting techniques for this
\ simpler black-and-white mode. If monochrome plotting already makes sense to
\ you, then let's move on to four colours.
\
\ As with mode 4, the mode 5 screen is laid out in memory using character
\ blocks. Indeed, the character blocks are the same size and height in terms of
\ bits and bytes, and pixel coordinates are identical in both screen modes (both
\ screen modes are 256 coordinates wide), so as far as the end used is
\ concerned, the screen modes are really similar. At the screen memory level,
\ however, there are some key differences.
\
\ The main difference is that each pixel can be one of four colours rather than
\ two, so as a result each pixel takes up twice as much memory (2 bits as
\ opposed to 1 bit). If we look at the way character blocks are laid out in
\ terms of bits, it looks the same as for mode 4 - here's what two neighbouring
\ character blocks look like in both modes:
\
\   01234567 01234567
\   01234567 01234567
\   01234567 01234567
\   01234567 01234567
\   01234567 01234567
\   01234567 01234567
\   01234567 01234567
\   01234567 01234567
\
\ However, while in mode 4 each bit represents one pixel, so the above block
\ would be 16 pixels across and 8 pixels high, in mode 5 each pixel takes up two
\ bits, so the above block shows as 8 pixels across and 8 pixels high. Pixels in
\ mode 5 are stretched out so they appear twice as wide as they are high, so
\ everything still fits on-screen in a sensible manner.
\
\ So we know that a character block row in mode 5 consists of four pixels in one
\ byte. The complicated part is how that byte stores those four pixels. If we
\ consider a character row byte like this:
\
\   01234567
\
\ then the first pixel is defined by bits 0 and 4, the second by bits 1 and 5,
\ and so on. If we split it up into nibbles:
\
\   0123 4567
\
\ then the first pixel is defined by the first bits of each nibble (0 and 4),
\ the second is defined by the second bits of each nibble (1 and 5), and so on
\ with bits 2 and 6, and bits 3 and 7. So consider this character row byte:
\
\   1111 0000
\
\ Each of the four bits has a 1 as the first bit and a 0 as the second bit,
\ giving %10, or 2, so this defines four pixels in a row of colour 2. And this
\ one:
\
\   1010 0011
\
\ contains the following pixels: %10, %00, %11 and %01, so this is a four-pixel
\ row consisting of pixel colours 2, 0, 3 and 1.
\
\ That aside, modes 4 and 5 work in the same way. Each character row takes up
\ 256 bytes, or exactly one page, so we can convert from screen coordinates to
\ character blocks using the same code. We can even work out the correct row in
\ the relevant character block in the same way, as the screen x- and
\ y-coordinate systems are identical. The only differences are:
\
\   * How we manipulate the individual character row bytes to support the nibble
\     system for four colours
\
\   * The fact that the y-coordinate still ranges from 0 to 256, but this time
\     there are only 128 pixels across the screen, so each pixel effectively has
\     two different screen coordinates (though we can easily cater for this by
\     ignoring the last bit of the y-coordinate)
\
\ We can even use a similar system to the TWOS table that we use in PIXEL, but
\ this time it's set up for the nibble system above. As a reminder, the TWOS
\ table provides ready-made bytes for plotting single pixels, such as this one
\ for plotting the third pixel in the row (out of 8):
\
\   TWOS+2  = %00100000
\
\ We can do the same for mode 5, but for the third pixel in the row (out of 4),
\ the table returns this value instead:
\
\   CTWOS+2  = %00100010
\
\ which breaks up into 0010 0010, or %11 in the third pixel. As with TWOS, we
\ can use this byte as a mask onto a 4-pixel colour byte to work out what to
\ poke into screen memory.
\
\ On the subject of 4-pixel colour bytes, this is what they look like for the
\ four colours used in the dashboard:
\
\   * Colour 0: %00000000 = &00 (black)
\
\   * Colour 1: %00001111 = &0F (red)
\
\   * Colour 2: %11110000 = &F0 (yellow/white)
\
\   * Colour 3: %11111111 = &FF (green/cyan)
\
\ So aside from having two bits per pixel and four pixels per character row,
\ mode 5 is pretty similar to the monochrome mode 4.

\
\ Deep dive: Extended screen coordinates
\ ======================================
\
\ Summary: The extended 16-bit screen coordinate system behind the space view
\
\ References: PROJ, LL145, LL118
\
\ When simulating its universe of ships, stars and space stations, Elite uses
\ large numbers - space is big, after all. The ship coordinates are stored as
\ sign-magnitude numbers with 16 bits for the magnitudes, while the planet and
\ sun coordinates go all the way up to 23-bit magnitudes (as they can be a lot
\ further away from us than ships and stations).
\
\ To maintain accuracy when projecting these shapes onto the screen, Elite uses
\ 16-bit screen coordinates for the calculations. The screen itself is only 256
\ pixels across, which fits into 8 bits, so this means during the projection,
\ ships often project onto coordinates that are off-screen.
\
\ This is intentional, and happens all the time when you're speeding past enemy
\ ships or slamming into the walls of a space station. Hammering the keyboard
\ with a sudden pitch-and-roll manoeuvre brings ships into view that were
\ otherwise minding their own business in the depths of space, but even though
\ we couldn't see them, they were there all along.
\
\ The extended screen coordinate system is a key part of the simulation. The
\ PROJ routine that projects space coordinates onto the screen produces 16-bit
\ coordinates as a result of the projection, but the way these 16-bit
\ coordinates relate to the screen is delightfully simple. Let's take a look.
\
\ A wall of screens
\ -----------------
\ First, let's consider a 256x256 screen (the space view in Elite is 256 pixels
\ wide and 192 pixels high, but we'll come to that in a moment). The screen
\ (x, y) coordinates would look like this, when expressed in hexadecimal:
\
\                         (&00, &00)      (&FF, &00)
\                                +----------+
\                                |          |
\                                |          |
\                                |          |
\                                +----------+
\                         (&00, &FF)      (&FF, &FF)
\
\ These coordinates are 8-bit values, as the screen is only 256 pixels wide. In
\ the extended coordinate system, there's an additional high byte. Let's set that
\ high byte for our screen to 0, so in terms of 16-bit coordinates, we have the
\ following coordinates:
\
\                      (&0000, &0000)    (&00FF, &0000)
\                                +----------+
\                                |          |
\                                |          |
\                                |          |
\                                +----------+
\                      (&0000, &00FF)    (&00FF, &00FF)
\
\ Let's describe this screen, where the high byte of the x- and y-coordinates is
\ &00, like this:
\
\                                +----------+
\                                |          |
\                                | &00, &00 |
\                                |          |
\                                +----------+
\
\ Now let's tack another 256x256 screen onto the right of this one. The screen
\ x-coordinates of this new screen would have a high byte of 1 instead of 0,
\ like this:
\
\                      (&0100, &0000)    (&01FF, &0000)
\                                +----------+
\                                |          |
\                                |          |
\                                |          |
\                                +----------+
\                      (&0100, &00FF)    (&01FF, &00FF)
\
\ which we can also write like this:
\
\                                +----------+
\                                |          |
\                                | &01, &00 |
\                                |          |
\                                +----------+
\
\ Putting the neighbours side by side, we get this:
\
\                          +----------+----------+
\                          |          |          |
\                          | &00, &00 | &01, &00 |
\                          |          |          |
\                          +----------+----------+
\
\ We can also bolt another screen onto the bottom, like this:
\
\                          +----------+----------+
\                          |          |          |
\                          | &00, &00 | &01, &00 |
\                          |          |          |
\                          +----------+----------+
\                          |          |
\                          | &00, &01 |
\                          |          |
\                          +----------+

\ values using two's complement, we can extend the screens in all directions,
\ like this:

\
\ This is the extended coordinate system used in Elite. You can think of it as
\ a bank of individual screens, where the entire view is projected onto all
\ the screens, but the game just shows the screen in the middle to the player.
\ The extended coordinates cover a 256x256 mesh of individual 256x256 screens,
\ which is easily enough space to project 3D space coordinates onto the screen
\ in the middle.
\
\ Checking whether a coordinate is on-screen
\ ------------------------------------------
\ The clever part about all this is how quickly we can check whether a screen
\ coordinate is visible in the space view, and how easy it is to get the actual
\ screen coordinate we need for drawing. Given an extended screen coordinate,
\ this is how we check whether it's on-screen:
\
\   * The first check is on the high byte. If either of the x- or y-coordinate's
\     high bytes is non-zero, then the coordinate isn't in the &00, &00 screen
\     in the above diagram, so it is definitely off-screen. If they are both
\     zero, we move on to the next check.
\
\   * If both high bytes are zero, then the second check is to make sure the
\     coordinate is in the space view rather than the dashboard. This is a
\     simple check whether the low byte of the y-coordinate is less than 192, as
\     the space view is made up of the top 192 pixel rows. If it is less than
\     192, the coordinate is indeed in the space view, otherwise it's hidden by
\     the dashboard.
\
\   * If the coordinate is in the space view, then we can simply take the low
\     bytes to get the screen coordinate for drawing.
\
\ In this way Elite effectively projects its universe onto a huge, cinematic
\ bank of screens, and then works out which parts of the projection appear in
\ the space view using three quick comparisons against 0 and 192. It's elegant
\ and fast, as so much of this game's code is.

\ Deep dive: Drawing meridians and equators
\ =========================================
\
\ Summary: The algorithms behind the meridians and equators of planets like Lave
\
\ References: PL9 (Part 2 of 3)
\
\ This deep dive is a work in progress. It covers part 2 of the PL9 routine,
\ which draws meridians and equators on planets.
\
\ Part 2 of PL9 calculates the following and, for each meridian, calls PLS2 to
\ do the actual plotting.
\
\ For meridian 1, we calculate the following
\
\   CNT2 = arctan(-nosev_z_hi / roofv_z_hi) / 4
\          with opposite sign to nosev_z_hi
\
\   (XX16   K2  ) = nosev_x / z
\   (XX16+1 K2+1) = nosev_y / z
\   (XX16+2 K2+2) = roofv_x / z
\   (XX16+3 K2+3) = roofv_y / z
\
\ Then PLS2 does this, with CNT2 stepping through a half circle from the
\ starting point set above:
\
\   K6(1 0) = K3(1 0) + (XX16 K2) * cos(CNT2) + (XX16+2 K2+2) * sin(CNT2)
\           = K3(1 0) + (nosev_x / z) * cos(CNT2) + (roofv_x / z) * sin(CNT2)
\
\   (T X) = - |XX16+1 K2+1| * cos(CNT2) - |XX16+3 K2+3| * sin(CNT2)
\         = - |nosev_y / z| * cos(CNT2) - |roofv_y / z| * sin(CNT2)
\
\ calling BLINE each iteration to plot segments to:
\
\   x = K6(1 0), y = K4(1 0) + (T X)
\
\ and counting CNT2 through half a circle from its starting point.
\
\ For meridian 2, we calculate the following
\
\   CNT2 = arctan(-nosev_z_hi / sidev_z_hi) / 4
\          with opposite sign to nosev_z_hi
\
\   (XX16   K2  ) = nosev_x / z
\   (XX16+1 K2+1) = nosev_y / z
\   (XX16+2 K2+2) = sidev_x / z
\   (XX16+3 K2+3) = sidev_y / z
\
\ Then PLS2 does this, with CNT2 stepping through a half circle from the
\ starting point set above:
\
\   K6(1 0) = K3(1 0) + (XX16 K2) * cos(CNT2) + (XX16+2 K2+2) * sin(CNT2)
\           = K3(1 0) + (nosev_x / z) * cos(CNT2) + (sidev_x / z) * sin(CNT2)
\

\    Summary: Calculate (Y A) = nosev_x / z
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following division of a specified value from one of the
\ orientation vectors (in this example, nosev_x):
\
\   (Y A) = nosev_x / z
\
\ where z is the z-coordinate of the planet from INWK. The result is an 8-bit
\ magnitude in A, with maximum value 254, and just a sign bit (bit 7) in Y.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       divide:
\
\                         * X = 9, 11, 13: divides nosev_x, nosev_y, nosev_z
\
\                         * X = 15, 17, 19: divides roofv_x, roofv_y, roofv_z
\
\                         * X = 21, 23, 25: divides sidev_x, sidev_y, sidev_z
\
\   INWK                The planet's ship data block
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The result as an 8-bit magnitude with maximum value 254
\
\   Y                   The sign of the result in bit 7
\
\   K+3                 Also the sign of the result in bit 7
\
\   X                   X gets incremented by 2 so it points to the next

\
\ Let's see what it takes to let there be light in the Elite universe.
\
\ Line by line
\ ------------
\ Unlike the planets, which are drawn as circles, the sun is drawn as a set of
\ horizontal lines, with one line per pixel line on-screen. This is how the
\ shimmering edges are drawn, by randomly making the lines shorter or longer
\ (more on that later).
\
\ Each line is defined by two parameters: the coordinate of the centre of the
\ line, and the length of the line from its centre to one end (which we call the
\ "half-width", as it's half the width of the full horizontal line). For the
\ sun, all the lines have the same centre x-coordinate, which is the same
\ x-coordinate as the centre of the sun.
\
\ Given this, we can draw the sun line by line, and all we need to calculate is
\ the half-width of the line for that particular y-coordinate. We can do this
\ using nothing more complicated than Pythagoras - there's no need for any
\ trigonometry here. Consider drawing a sun line near the bottom of a sun with
\ radius K, let's say the line that is V lines below the centre. It looks
\ something like this:
\
\                          _ - _
\                       =         =
\                     =             =                   |`.
\                    =               =                  |  `.  K
\   We want          =       |`.     =                V |    `.
\   to draw           =      |  `.  =         __-->     |      `.
\   this line ------>  ._____|____`.   ___.--´          +--------`
\                          - _ -                     SQRT(K^2 - V^2)
\
\ Looking at the triangle from the centre of the sun down to the horizontal
\ line we want to draw, we can apply Pythagoras to calculate that the half-width
\ of the line we want to draw is SQRT(K^2 - V^2), so along with the value of V
\ we have all the data we need to draw that line, and by extension the whole
\ ball of fire.
\
\ Flickering fringes
\ ------------------
\ The sun's flickering fringes are easy enough to implement in this model.
\
\ We start by calculating a figure between 0 and 7, with bigger numbers for
\ bigger suns, and call this the "fringe size", which we store in CNT. This
\ defines the width of the pulsating fringe around the sun (which explains why
\ the sun stops flickering when it's far away - it has a fringe size of 0).
\
\ Then, when calculating the half-width of each line using the method above, we
\ simply pick a random number between 0 and the fringe size, and add it to the
\ half-width. This makes the sun symmetrical around its vertical meridian, and
\ as the random number changes for each line and for each redraw of the sun, the
\ sun's fringes shimmer and flicker. It's simple but very effective, and it adds
\ very little effort, even to the erase procedure, as we can see in the next
\ section.
\
\ Drawing and storing sun lines with SUN
\ --------------------------------------
\ As with all objects in the sky, we can erase the sun from the screen by
\ drawing it a second time in the same place as before, so it cancels out the
\ existing sun using EOR logic. Although the maths above isn't complex, it is
\ still pretty time-consuming, especially with a large sun on the screen, so
\ as with the planets, the sun has its own line heap, stored at LSO, which
\ stores the data for every line in the current sun.
\
\ The first location at LSO has a special meaning:
\
\   * LSO = 1   indicates the line heap contains data
\   * LSO = &FF indicates the line heap is empty
\
\ Because the sun is made up of lines and it can fill the entire space view,
\ the sun's line heap contains 192 values, one for each of the lines on the
\ screen. The value in LSO+Y contains details of the sun's line on pixel row Y,
\ with a 0 indicating there is no line, and a non-zero value containing the
\ half-width of the sun line on that y-coordinate. Along with the sun's centre
\ coordinates in SUNX and SUNY, the line heap contains everything we need to
\ know in order to draw the sun, all without having to recalculate anything.
\
\ This also applies to the random fringe factor that we add to the half-width to
\ make the sun shimmer. As we're only storing the half-width and that contains
\ the random fringe size, we can store and redraw shimmering suns with no more
\ effort then a clean ball sun. It's remarkably elegant for such a complicated-
\ looking graphical effect.
\
\ The SUN routine combines the drawing of the new sun and the removal of the
\ old one into one pass through the line heap, from the bottom of the screen
\ to the top (so from the end of the heap to the start). We do this in part 2
\ by starting at the bottom and plotting each sun line in turn from the line
\ heap as we move up the screen. As each line is plotted, thus erasing the
\ old sun, it is removed from the line heap.
\
\ We do this until we reach the point where we need to start drawing the new
\ sun, at which point we move into part 3. This draws two horizontal lines that
\ between them manage to remove the old sun's line and draw the new sun's line
\ in the most efficient way. Each time, we replace the value in the line heap
\ with the new line's half-width, so the new sun can be erased in the same way.
\ Once the new sun is drawn, we then keep heading up the screen in part 4, where
\ we redraw any remaining lines from the old sun, thus removing them from the
\ screen, and leaving just the new sun on show.
\
\ The LSO line heap block shares its memory with the ship line heap for the
\ space station. This memory can be shared as our local bubble of universe can
\ support either the sun or a space station, but not both.

\ Deep dive: Drawing circles
\ ==========================
\
\ Summary: The routines that draw planets and the hyperspace and docking tunnels
\
\ References: CIRCLE, CIRCLE2, TT128
\
\ You never forget your first journey in Elite, and a lot of that is down to the
\ circle routine. The launch tunnel rushing past as you punch your way out of
\ the station - that's the circle routine. The planet Lave, hanging in space in
\ front of you in all its rotating glory - that's the circle routine. The nearby
\ systems you can choose to visit on the Short-range Chart are all those inside
\ a circle drawn by the circle routine. And the hyperspace tunnel? You guessed
\ it. It's the circle routine again.
\
\ Circles are drawn by the CIRCLE2 routine. This routine draws a circle by
\ starting at the bottom of the circle - or at 6 o'clock if you think of it as a
\ clock face - and moving anti-clockwise in steps defined by the size of the
\ step size in STP. The whole circle is divided into 64 steps and the step
\ number is stored in CNT, so if STP were 2, CNT would be 0, 2, 4 and so on up
\ to and including 64. So we work our way around the circle like this:
\
\   * CNT = 0-16  is the bottom-right quadrant (6 o'clock to 3 o'clock)
\   * CNT = 16-32 is the top-right quadrant    (3 o'clock to 12 o'clock)
\   * CNT = 32-48 is the top-left quadrant     (12 o'clock to 9 o'clock)
\   * CNT = 48-64 is the bottom-left quadrant  (9 o'clock to 6 o'clock)
\
\ If we can work out the coordinates of the point on the circle at step CNT,
\ then we can draw the circle by simply drawing lines between each point, with
\ each line being a segment of the circle. We can draw smooth circles by having
\ smaller segments, as with the circles on the charts, or we can draw more
\ polygonal circles by having large segments, as with the launch tunnel. The
\ circle's "step size" determines how many of the 64 points make up each
\ segment, so smaller step sizes give smoother circles (the step size is
\ typically 2, 4 or 8 points).
\
\ So let's consider the step where CNT is around 5, say, so that's around 5
\ o'clock. The sine table at SNE contains 32 values that cover half a circle, so
\ we can think of CNT as the angle that we have travelled through as we work our
\ way round the circle, with 64 covering the whole thing. So 5 o'clock looks
\ like this (I've put a "c" for the angle CNT as it's a bit of a tight squeeze):
\
\         _ - _
\      =         =                     |`.                          |`.
\    =             =                   |c `.                        |c `.  K
\   =               =                  |    `. K         K * cos(c) |    `.
\   =       |`.     =        __-->     |      `.                    |      `.
\    =      |  `.  =  ___.--´          |        `.                  +--------`
\     =     |    `.                    |     __--´    ----->        K * sin(c)
\      `--__|__--´                     |__--´
\
\ So if the centre of the circle (the top of the triangle above) is at the
\ origin (0, 0), then using basic trigonometry, we can see that at step number
\ CNT, the point on the circle is at these coordinates:
\
\   x = K * sin(CNT)
\   y = K * cos(CNT)
\
\ The SNE table only gives us positive results, so for other quadrants of the
\ circle, we'll need to set the signs of x and y according to the particular
\ quadrant we're in, but the magnitude of the coordinates will be as above.
\ Specifically, we need to do the following (as screen y-coordinates are
\ positive down the screen and screen x-coordinates are positive to the right):
\
\   * CNT = 0-16  is the bottom-right quadrant so x is +ve and y is +ve
\   * CNT = 16-32 is the top-right quadrant    so x is +ve and y is -ve
\   * CNT = 32-48 is the top-left quadrant     so x is -ve and y is -ve
\   * CNT = 48-64 is the bottom-left quadrant  so x is -ve and y is +ve
\
\ To get the final screen coordinates of the point at count CNT, we have to add
\ the results from above to the coordinates of the centre of the circle, as the
\ origin of the screen is at the top-left, not in the centre of the circle. We
\ do this with the following:
\
\   x = K * sin(CNT) + K3(1 0)
\   y = K * cos(CNT) + K4(1 0)
\
\ And that's how we draw the planet and chart circles in a step-wise fashion
\ using the sine table.

\    Summary: Calculate (Y A P) = 222 * roofv_x / z
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, with X determining the vector to use:
\
\   (Y A P) = 222 * roofv_x / z
\
\ though in reality only (Y A) is used.
\
\ Although the code below supports a range of values of X, in practice the
\ routine is only called with X = 15, and then again after X has been
\ incremented to 17. So the values calculated by PLS1 use roofv_x first, then
\ roofv_y. The comments below refer to roofv_x, for the first call.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       divide:
\
\                         * X = 15: divides roofv_x
\
\                         * X = 17: divides roofv_y
\
\ Returns:
\
\   X                   X gets incremented by 2 so it points to the next
\                       coordinate in this orientation vector (so consecutive
\                       calls to the routine will start with x, then move onto y
\                       and then z)

\
\ Remove the ship in slot X from our local bubble of universe. This happens

\ outside our local bubble.
\
\ We also use this routine when we move out of range of the space station, in

\    Summary: Sound data
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Sound data. To make a sound, the NOS1 routine copies the four relevant sound
\ bytes to XX16, and NO3 then makes the sound. The sound numbers are shown in
\ the table, and are always multiples of 8. Generally, sounds are made by
\ calling the NOISE routine with the sound number in A.
\
\ These bytes are passed to OSWORD 7, and are the equivalents to the parameters
\ passed to the SOUND keyword in BASIC. The parameters therefore have these
\ meanings:
\
\   channel/flush, amplitude (or envelope number if 1-4), pitch, duration
\
\ For the channel/flush parameter, the first byte is the channel while the
\ second is the flush control (where a flush control of 0 queues the sound,
\ while a flush control of 1 makes the sound instantly). When written in
\ hexadecimal, the first figure gives the flush control, while the second is
\ the channel (so &13 indicates flush control = 1 and channel = 3).
\
\ So when we call NOISE with A = 40 to make a long, low beep, then this is
\ effectively what the NOISE routine does:
\
\   SOUND &13, &F4, &0C, &08
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 3, and with amplitude &F4
\ (-12), pitch &0C (2) and duration &08 (8). Meanwhile, to make the hyperspace
\ sound, the NOISE routine does this:
\
\   SOUND &10, &02, &60, &10
\
\ which makes a sound with flush control 1 on channel 0, using envelope 2,
\ and with pitch &60 (96) and duration &10 (16). The four sound envelopes (1-4)
\ are set up in elite-loader.asm.

\
\ Deep dive: Generating random numbers
\ ====================================
\
\ Summary: The algorithm behind Elite's random number generation routines
\
\ References: DORND, DORND2
\
\ Games like Elite need a steady stream of random numbers. They are used all
\ over the place to add an element of chance to gameplay, whether it's in the
\ main flight loop when deciding whether or not to spawn an angry Thargoid in
\ the depths of space, or on arrival in a new system where the market prices
\ have a random element mixed into the procedural generation, so they are never
\ exactly the same.
\
\ Random numbers on Elite are generated by the DORND and DORND2 routines. These
\ routines use the four seed bytes at RAND to RAND+3 to generate random numbers,
\ though I am still trying to work out how this works, and the difference
\ between the two different entry points, one of which clears the C flag first.
\
\ Let's look at the algorithm, anyway.
\
\ There are two calculations of two 8-bit numbers in the DORND routine. The
\ first pair is at RAND and RAND+2 (let's call them r0 and r2) and the second
\ pair is at RAND+1 and RAND+3 (let's call them r1 and r3).
\
\ The values of r0 and r2 are not read by any other routine apart from this
\ one, so they are effectively internal to the random number generation
\ routine. r1 and r3, meanwhile, are returned in A and X with each call to
\ DORND, and along with the returned values of the C and V flags, form the
\ the random results we're looking for.
\
\ The seeds are overwritten in three places:
\
\   * All four locations are updated by EXL2, using a STA &FFFD,Y instruction
\     with Y = 2, 3, 4, 5 (so this points the write to zero page location &00,
\     which is where RAND is located, in the first four bytes of memory).
\
\   * r0 is written to at the start of M% in the main loop, to seed the random
\     number generator. Here, r0 is set to the first byte of the ship data block
\     at K% (which is the x_lo coordinate for the planet).
\
\   * r3 is written to in EX4 as part of the explosion routine, with r3 being
\     set to the seventh byte of the ship data block at K%+6 (which is the z_lo
\     coordinate for the planet).
\
\ r0 and r2 follow the following sequence through successive calls to DORND,
\ going from r0 and r2 to r0´ and r2´ with each call:
\
\   r2´ = ((r0 << 1) mod 256) + C
\   r0´ = r2´ + r2 + bit 7 of r0
\
\ C is the C flag on entry to the routine. If this routine is entered with the C
\ flag clear, e.g. via DORND2, then if bit 0 of RAND+2 is 0, it will remain at 0.
\
\ r1 and r3 (which are returned in A and X) follow this number sequence through
\ successive calls to DORND, going from r1 and r3 to r1´ and r3´:
\
\   A = r1´ = r1 + r3 + C
\   X = r3´ = r1
\

\   * Spawn a trader, i.e. a Cobra Mk III that isn't attacking anyone, with one
\     missile and a 50% chance of having an E.C.M., a speed between 16 and 31,

\

\
\   * Process more key presses (red function keys, docked keys etc.)
\
\ It also support joining the main loop with a key already "pressed", so we can
\ jump into the main game loop to perform a specific action. In practice, this
\ is used when we enter the docking bay in BAY to display Status Mode (red key
\ f8), and when we finish buying or selling cargo in BAY2 to jump to the

\ Deep dive: Program flow of the main game loop
\ =============================================
\
\ Summary: The sequence of events in the main game loop and the main flight loop
\
\ References: TT170, MLOOP, M%
\
\ Here is a high-level look at the main program flow, from the title screen to
\ the end of life as we know it, via the main game loop and the main flight
\ loop. The following is mainly about the flight aspects of the game, as the
\ docked screens don't really have much of a flow, they just get shown when the
\ relevant keys are pressed.
\
\ Each section is broken down into parts that mirror the structure of the source
\ code, so it should be easy enough to find the relevant parts mentioned below.
\
\ Title sequence
\ --------------
\ 1/2 TT170
\
\   * Show "load commander?" title screen (TITLE)
\   * Process loading of commander file, if selected
\   * Copy last saved commander NA% to current commander TP
\   * Show "press fire or space" title screen (TITLE)
\   * Set target system to home system
\   * Process arrival in system closest to target
\
\ 2/2 BAY
\
\   * Set the docked flag
\   * Jump to the docked section of the main game loop (FRCE, see below) with f8
\     "pressed" to show Status Mode
\
\ Main game loop
\ --------------
\ 1/6 (potentially called from part 2)
\
\   * Spawn a trader
\
\ 2/6
\
\   * Call the main flight loop (M%, see below)
\   * Clear any expired in-flight messages from the screen
\   * On 255 out of 256 iterations, skip straight to MLOOP in part 5
\   * Potentially spawn a trader by jumping up to part 1
\   * Potentially spawn a cargo canister or an asteroid
\
\ 3/6
\
\   * Potentially spawn a cop, with a higher chance if we've been bad
\
\ 4/6
\
\   * Potentially spawn a lone bounty hunter, a Thargoid, or a group of 1-4
\     pirates
\
\ 5/6 MLOOP (main entry point for main game loop)
\
\   * Cool down the lasers
\   * Update the dashboard (DIALS)
\   * If this is not a space view, scan for cursor keys
\
\ 6/6 FRCE (entry point for displaying a specific screen)
\
\   * Process function keys and other non-flight keys (TT102)
\   * If docked, loop back to part 5 (MLOOP)
\   * If in-flight, loop back to part 2
\
\ Main flight loop
\ ----------------
\ 1/16 M% (main entry point for main flight loop)
\
\   * Seed the random number generator
\
\ 2/16
\
\   * Calculate the alpha and beta angles from the current pitch and roll
\
\ 3/16
\
\   * Scan for flight keys and process the results
\
\ Now start looping through all the ships in the local bubble, and for each one,
\ do parts 4-12:
\
\ 4/16
\
\   * Copy the ship's data block from K% to INWK
\
\   * Set XX0 to point to the ship's blueprint (if this is a ship)
\
\ 5/16
\
\   * If an energy bomb has been set off and this ship can be killed, kill it
\     and increase the kill tally
\
\ 6/16
\
\   * Move the ship in space by calling MVEIT (see the deep dive on "Program
\     flow of the ship-moving routine" for details). MVEIT also calls the main
\     tactics routine at TACTICS (see the deep dive on "Program flow of the
\     tactics routine" for more)
\
\   * Copy the updated ship's data block from INWK back to K%
\
\ 7/16
\
\   * Check how close we are to this ship and work out if we are docking,
\     scooping or colliding with it
\
\ 8/16
\
\   * Process us potentially scooping this item
\
\ 9/16
\
\   * Process docking with space station, which can take us to the main loop via
\     BAY (if we dock successfully) or DEATH (if we don't)
\
\ 10/16
\
\   * Remove scooped item after both successful and failed scoopings
\   * Process collisions, which can lead to DEATH
\
\ 11/16
\
\   * If this isn't the front space view, flip the ship coordinates' axes (PLUT)
\   * Process missile lock
\   * Process our laser firing
\
\ 12/16
\
\   * Draw the ship (LL9)
\   * Process the removal of killed ships
\
\ Loop back up to part 4 to do the next ship in the local bubble until we have
\ processed them all
\
\ 13/16
\
\   * Show energy bomb effect (if applicable)
\   * Charge shields and energy banks
\
\ 14/16
\
\   * Spawn a space station if we are close enough to the planet
\
\ 15/16
\
\   * Perform an altitude check with the planet, which can lead to DEATH
\   * Perform an an altitude check with the sun, which can also lead to DEATH
\   * Process fuel scooping
\
\ 16/16
\
\   * Process laser pulsing
\   * Process E.C.M. energy drain
\   * Call the stardust routine if we are on a space view (STARS)
\   * Return from the main flight loop
\
\ Death
\ -----
\ 1/1 DEATH
\
\   * We have been killed, so display the chaos of our destruction above a "GAME
\     OVER" sign
\
\   * Clean up a number of variables and workspaces, ready for the next attempt
\
\   * Jump up to TT170 to start the whole process again

\ Bundled with Elite, and easy to miss amongst the razzmatazz of the manual,
\ novel, function key strip and control summary card, was the competition entry
\ form. Unfortunately the entry deadline of March 1985 has long since passed,
\ but back in the day, budding players could fill out the postcard in hope of
\ joining the Order of Elite, with the six best players standing a chance of
\ being invited to the "national Elite tournament" in April 1985. Accordingly,
\ piles of postcards poured into Acornsoft's offices and sat in tottering stacks
\ around the office, waiting for some lucky soul to process them all.
\
\ My postcard was in there somewhere.
\
\ Apart from your name and address, the postcard asked for two things: your
\ credit balance, and the competition code that the game displayed on-screen
\ during the saving process. These two bits of information enabled Acornsoft to
\ work out who was a legitimately amazing pilot, and who had cheated, using a
\ decoding algorithm that was a closely guarded secret.
\
\ This algorithm can be seen in the BBC BASIC program called UNPACK that's
\ included on the Elite source disc. Some lucky Acornsoft employee presumably
\ had to sit there and enter these two bits of information into UNPACK, which
\ would then tell them whether the cash levels on the postcard were correct, and
\ most importantly, what the player's combat rank was. UNPACK could also tell
\ them whether that person had tampered with their save file, and it also
\ revealed which version of the game this code was from, which could then be
\ cross-checked against the colour of the postcard (blue for the BBC Micro
\ cassette version, brown for the BBC Micro disc version, and green for the
\ Acorn Electron version).
\
\ And then... onto the next postcard. I bet that was a fun job.
\
\ People would have sold their grandmothers to get hold of UNPACK, so let's see
\ how it all works, starting with the competition flags.
\
\ The competition flags
\ ---------------------
\ The competition flags at location COK track three vital bits of information
\ that get encoded into the final competition code. They are as follows:
\
\   * Bit 0 is set in routine ptg if we hold CTRL during hyperspace to force a
\     mis-jump into witchspace (having first paused the game and toggled on the
\     author credits with X). UNPACK does not report the status of this bit, so
\     presumably manually mis-jumping was not regarded as cheating by Acornsoft,
\     but perhaps it was recorded to see if anyone found this way of hunting
\     Thargoids
\
\   * Bit 1 is set if this commander file has ever been saved by the cassette
\     version of BBC Micro Elite. Note that commander files can be loaded into
\     and saved from any BBC Micro or Electron version of the game, so this flag
\     indicates that it was, at some point, saved from the cassette version, and
\     it can be set alongside the other platform bits, if applicable
\
\   * Bit 2 is set if this commander file has ever been saved by the disc
\     version of BBC Micro Elite. It is also set by the 6502 Second Processor
\     version, but this version was launched after the competition expired, so
\     presumably the authors just reused the disc version's save routine code
\
\   * Bit 3 is set if this commander file has ever been saved by the Acorn
\     Electron version of Elite
\
\   * Bits 4-6 are not set by any of the above versions, but if they are set in
\     the commander file, the platform is reported as "Something else??" by
\     UNPACK
\
\   * Bit 7 is set if the CHK and CHK2 checksums in the commander file do not
\     match, which indicates that the commander data has been tampered with.
\     CHK2 is set to CHK EOR &A9 when the file is saved, so anyone tampering
\     with the file would not only need to update the CHK checksum accordingly,
\     they would also need to update CHK2 as well. The game hangs if you try to
\     load a commander file with an incorrect CHK value, but it lets an
\     incorrect CHK2 through, so the chances are a hacker wouldn't know that
\     CHK2 needed to be correct for a valid competition entry
\
\ The competition flag is buried within the competition code that players had to
\ copy onto the competition postcard, so now let's look at the competition code.
\
\ The competition code
\ --------------------
\ The competition code is calculated and shown on screen in the SVE routine when
\ the commander file is saved. It's a four-byte number with a maximum value of
\ 4,294,967,295, which fits nicely into the ten-box slot on the competition
\ postcard.
\
\ It is calculated into K(0 1 2 3), which is a big-endian number with the most
\ significant byte in K and the least significant in K+3 (so it's stored in the
\ same way that the player's cash is stored in location CASH, and it's printed
\ out by the same BPRNT routine that displays the credit balance). The
\ calculation is done in this order:
\
\   K   = CHK OR %10000000
\   K+2 = K EOR COK
\   K+1 = K+2 EOR CASH+2
\   K+3 = K+1 EOR &5A EOR TALLY+1
\
\ The result is then printed on-screen using BPRNT, and the file is saved.
\
\ Extracting data from the competition code
\ -----------------------------------------
\ So to extract the various bits of information encoded in the competition code,
\ we can apply the algorithm in UNPACK, described here using the same variable
\ names as used UNPACK, so you can follow along if you want. The following makes
\ use of the following facts about EOR:
\
\   * EOR is commutative:
\
\       A EOR B = B EOR A
\
\   * EOR is transitive:
\
\       (A EOR B) EOR C = A EOR (B EOR C)
\
\   * EOR is its own self-inverse:
\
\       A EOR A = 0
\
\   * EOR 0 is the identity:
\
\       A EOR 0 = 0 EOR A = A
\
\ Given this, let's see how UNPACK extracts the data from the competition code.
\
\   * Split the code into the four bytes by AND'ing as follows (UNPACK has to do
\     some division to avoid BBC BASIC overflow errors, but this is effectively
\     what it does):
\
\       B1% = code AND &000000FF (i.e. K+3)
\       B2% = code AND &0000FF00 (i.e. K+2)
\       B3% = code AND &00FF0000 (i.e. K+1)
\       B4% = code AND &FF000000 (i.e. K)
\
\   * Extract COK:
\
\       B% = B4% EOR B2%
\          = K EOR K+2
\          = K EOR (K EOR COK)
\          = (K EOR K) EOR COK
\          = COK
\
\   * Extract CASH+2:
\
\       B% = B2% EOR B3%
\          = K+2 EOR K+1
\          = (K EOR COK) EOR (K+2 EOR CASH+2)
\          = (K EOR COK) EOR ((K EOR COK) EOR CASH+2)
\          = ((K EOR COK) EOR (K EOR COK)) EOR CASH+2
\          = CASH+2
\
\   * Extract TALLY+1:
\
\       B% = B3% EOR B1% EOR &5A
\          = K+1 EOR K+3 EOR &5A
\          = (K+2 EOR CASH+2) EOR (K+1 EOR &5A EOR TALLY+1) EOR &5A
\          = (K+2 EOR CASH+2) EOR ((K+2 EOR CASH+2) EOR &5A EOR TALLY+1) EOR &5A
\          = ((K+2 EOR CASH+2) EOR (K+2 EOR CASH+2)) EOR &5A EOR TALLY+1 EOR &5A
\          = &5A EOR TALLY+1 EOR &5A
\          = (&5A EOR &5A) EOR TALLY+1
\          = TALLY+1
\
\ So in this way we can extract the competition flags (COK), one byte of the
\ cash amount (CASH+2) and the high byte of the combat rank (TALLY+1). We can
\ check the extracted cash byte against the cash amount entered on the postcard,
\ as follows:
\
\   CASH+2 = (cash total from postcard * 10) AND &FF00
\
\ and we can work out the combat rank from TALLY+1 using the same algorithm as
\ the STATUS routine:
\
\   Competent     TALLY+1 = 1 to 2
\   Dangerous     TALLY+1 = 2 to 9
\   Deadly        TALLY+1 = 10 to 24
\   Elite         TALLY+1 = 25 and up
\
\ and from the value COK we know whether the file has been tampered with, which
\ platforms the game has been played on, and whether the player has done any
\ manual mis-jumps.
\
\ That's pretty clever stuff for a few digits on a postcard...

\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in K3
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Normalise the vector in K3, which has 16-bit values and separate sign bits,
\ and store the normalised version in XX15 as a signed 8-bit vector.
\
\ A normalised vector (also known as a unit vector) has length 1, so this
\ routine takes an existing vector in K3 and scales it so the length of the
\ new vector is 1. This is used in two places: when drawing the compass, and
\ when applying AI tactics to ships.
\
\ We do this in two stages. This stage shifts the 16-bit vector coordinates in
\ K3 to the left as far as they will go without losing any bits off the end, so
\ we can then take the high bytes and use them as the most accurate 8-bit vector
\ to normalise. Then the next stage (in routine NORM) does the normalisation.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3(2 1 0)           The 16-bit x-coordinate as (x_sign x_hi x_lo), where
\                       x_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(5 4 3)           The 16-bit y-coordinate as (y_sign y_hi y_lo), where
\                       y_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(8 7 6)           The 16-bit z-coordinate as (z_sign z_hi z_lo), where
\                       z_sign is just bit 7
\
\ Returns:
\
\   XX15                The normalised vector, with:
\
\                         * The x-coordinate in XX15
\
\                         * The y-coordinate in XX15+1

\
\ Deep dive: The key logger
\ =========================
\
\ Summary: Supporting concurrent in-flight key presses using a key logger
\
\ References: KYTB, KL, DKS1, DK4, DOKEY
\
\ There's a lot to do when piloting a space ship. Pitching and rolling while
\ slamming on the brakes to avoid missing the docking slot; firing lasers while
\ activating the E.C.M. and slamming your foot on the accelerator; targeting a
\ missile while switching between space views, trying to track down your foe...
\ it's all in a day's work for your average Cobra Mk III pilot.
\
\ Unfortunately, most 8-bit micros weren't built to handle multiple concurrent
\ key presses. The Machine Operating System (MOS) in the BBC Micro can handle up
\ to two concurrent key presses, on top of the modifier keys; this known as a
\ "two-key rollover", and it's generally fine for typing, as you rarely intend
\ to press more than two letter keys at the same time. However, for a game where
\ you legitimately might want to pitch up, roll right, fire lasers, slow down
\ and launch a missile all at the same time (by pressing "X", ">", "A", "?" and
\ "M" concurrently), a simple two-key rollover just won't do.
\
\ Elite therefore implements its own logging system that listens for key presses
\ for all the important flight controls, and stores their details in a keyboard
\ logger for the main loop to process in its own time. There are 15 of these
\ flight controls, which are split up into the seven primary controls (speed,
\ pitch, roll and lasers) and eight secondary controls (energy bomb, escape pod,
\ missile controls, E.C.M., in-system jump and the docking computer). The key
\ logger effectively implements an 8-key rollover for each of the primary
\ controls, plus one secondary control, which is more than enough to make the
\ game responsive to our every whim.
\
\ How the key logger works
\ ------------------------
\ The heart of the key logger system is the table at location KL. This contains
\ one byte for each of the 15 flight controls listed in the keyboard lookup
\ table at KYTB, starting from KL+1 for "?" (slow down) and going through to
\ KL+15 for "C" (which turns on the docking computer). Each key logger location
\ has its own label, so KY1 = KL+1, KY2 = KL+2 up to KY15 = KL+15, where KY1
\ corresponds to the internal key number in KYTB+1, KY2 to the key number in
\ KYTB+2, and so on.
\
\ The various keyboard scanning routines can set the relevant byte in the KL
\ table to &FF to denote that a particular key is being pressed. The logger is
\ cleared to zero (to denote that no keys are being pressed) by the U% routine.
\
\ The main routines that populate the key logger are:
\
\   * DKS4, which scans the keyboard for a specific key
\
\   * DKS1, which calls DKS4 and updates the key logger with the result
\
\   * DOKEY, which calls DKS1 for each of the primary flight controls
\
\   * DK4, which scans for the secondary flight controls
\
\ If a key is being pressed that is not in the keyboard table at KYTB, then it
\ can be stored in the first location in the key logger, KL, as this isn't
\ mapped to a KYTB key. This is done in routine DK4, for example, so we almost
\ never miss a key press.
\
\ In addition, the joystick fire button is checked, and if it is pressed, the
\ key logger entry for laser fire ("A") is set, so there is only one location
\ to check when processing laser fire.

\    Summary: Orthonormalise the orientation vectors for a ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.
\
\ ******************************************************************************
\
\ Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors
\ ======================================
\
\ Summary: Making the orientation vectors orthonormal, and why this matters
\
\ References: TIDY, NORM
\
\ There are an awful lot of rotations in Elite. When we pitch or roll, we rotate
\ the entire universe around our ship, so every ship in our local bubble of
\ universe gets rotated in space every time we tap our controls. Not only do we
\ rotate the ship's position in space by our pitch and roll in part 5 of MVEIT,
\ but we also rotate the ship's orientation vectors by our pitch and roll in
\ MVS4, and we rotate the orientation vectors again, this time around the ship's
\ centre, when we apply the ship's own pitch and roll in part 8 of MVEIT.
\
\ One of the problems with all this rotating is that we use the small angle
\ approximation to rotate all these vectors in space. This is not completely
\ accurate, so the three orientation vectors tend to get stretched over time, so
\ periodically we have to tidy the vectors with the TIDY routine.
\
\ Elite's calculations rely on having orthonormal orientation vectors, which
\ means the three orientation vectors are both orthogonal (perpendicular to each
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1). The TIDY routine therefore
\ tidies up the vectors by making them orthonormal, and Elite tidies one ship
\ on most iterations of the main flight loop (it tidies one ship slot on 13 out
\ of every 16 iterations).
\
\ The challenge, then, is to take the three orientation vectors - nosev, roofv
\ and sidev - and tweak them so that they are orthogonal and normal once again.
\ Let's call these new, tweaked vectors nosev´, roofv´ and sidev´, and let's
\ look at how we can calculate them.
\
\ The first vector, nosev´
\ ------------------------
\ First, let's normalise nosev, so it has length 1 (stored internally as 96),
\ and let's call this nosev´. We start with the node vector, as normalising it
\ doesn't change the direction that the ship is pointing in, so if we happen to
\ be looking at a ship as it gets tidied, at least it won't change direction.
\
\ The second vector, roofv´
\ -------------------------
\ Next, we want to tweak roofv into a new vector roofv´, where roofv´ is
\ perpendicular to nosev´. When two vectors are perpendicular, their dot product
\ is zero, so this means:
\
\   roofv´ . nosev´ = 0
\
\ This expands to:
\
\   nosev_x´ * roofv_x´ + nosev_y´ * roofv_y´ + nosev_z´ * roofv_z´ = 0
\
\ which we can expand to the following:
\
\   roofv_x´ = -(nosev_y´ * roofv_y´ + nosev_z´ * roofv_z´) / nosev_x´
\   roofv_y´ = -(nosev_x´ * roofv_x´ + nosev_z´ * roofv_z´) / nosev_y´
\   roofv_z´ = -(nosev_x´ * roofv_x´ + nosev_y´ * roofv_y´) / nosev_z´
\
\ Because time is of the essence, we would rather only calculate one of these,
\ so we do a clever trick. If you think of two arbitrary lines on a piece of
\ paper, then given any direction, it's possible to move the end of one of the
\ lines in that direction so that the lines become parallel. In the case of our
\ vectors, this means we can tweak roofv in one axis only - i.e. only change one
\ of its x, y, and z coordinates - and can still get a vector that's at
\ right-angles to nosev´.
\
\ So let's say that we tweak roofv in the x-axis only, then that means we leave
\ roofv_y and roofv_z alone - so roofv_y´ = roofv_y and roofv_z´ = roofv_z. So
\ this means:
\
\   roofv_x´ = -(nosev_y´ * roofv_y + nosev_z´ * roofv_z) / nosev_x´
\   roofv_y´ = roofv_y
\   roofv_z´ = roofv_z
\
\ So we can just tweak roofv_x to roofv_x´, using this calculation:
\
\   roofv_x´ = -(nosev_y´ * roofv_y + nosev_z´ * roofv_z) / nosev_x´
\
\ and roofv´ will be perpendicular to nosev; then all we need to do is normalise
\ roofv´ and we've got our second orthonormal vector.
\
\ We can do the same with any of the axes, leading to these two equations:
\
\   roofv_y´ = -(nosev_x´ * roofv_x + nosev_z´ * roofv_z) / nosev_y´
\   roofv_z´ = -(nosev_x´ * roofv_x + nosev_y´ * roofv_y) / nosev_z´
\
\ So how do we choose which coordinate axis to move? Well, seeing as we are
\ going to be dividing by one of the coordinates of nosev´ in our calculation,
\ and dividing by big numbers in integer arithmetic isn't so accurate (as we're
\ dealing in integers here, not floating point numbers), we could always choose
\ an equation with a low nosev value, and this is exactly what Elite does. First
\ we check whether nosev_x´ is small, and if it is, we do this one:
\
\   roofv_x´ = -(nosev_y´ * roofv_y + nosev_z´ * roofv_z) / nosev_x´
\
\ Otherwise we check whether nosev_y´ is small, and if it is, we do this one:
\
\   roofv_y´ = -(nosev_x´ * roofv_x + nosev_z´ * roofv_z) / nosev_y´
\
\ Otherwise, we have no choice but to do this one:
\
\   roofv_z´ = -(nosev_x´ * roofv_x + nosev_y´ * roofv_y) / nosev_z´
\
\ And finally we normalise roofv, so it has length 1 (stored internally as 96)
\
\ The third vector, sidev´
\ ------------------------
\ So we have two vectors in nosev´ and roofv´ that are orthogonal and normal, so
\ we just need to find a vector that is perpendicular to these two. There's an
\ easy way to calculate such a vector, by using the cross-product.
\
\ The cross-product works like this. Consider two vectors, a and b, which have
\ an angle theta between them. The cross-product of these two vectors, a x b,
\ gives us another vector that is at right-angles to the first two, and which
\ has length |a| * |b| * sin(theta).
\
\ In other words, if we calculate the following:
\
\   sidev = nosev x roofv
\
\ which we can do by breaking it down into axes:
\
\   [ sidev_x ]   [ nosev_x´ ]   [ roofv_x´ ]
\   [ sidev_y ] = [ nosev_y´ ] x [ roofv_y´ ]
\   [ sidev_z ]   [ nosev_z´ ]   [ roofv_z´ ]
\
\                 [ nosev_z´ * roofv_y´ - nosev_y´ * roofv_z´ ]
\               = [ nosev_x´ * roofv_z´ - nosev_z´ * roofv_x´ ]
\                 [ nosev_y´ * roofv_x´ - nosev_x´ * roofv_y´ ]
\
\ then this sets sidev to a vector that is perpendicular to the others, and
\ which has length |nosev´| * |roofv´| * sin(theta). We know that because
\ nosev´ and roofv´ are orthonormal, theta must be a right-angle, and
\ |nosev´| and |roofv´| must be 1, so this means sidev has length 1:
\
\   |nosev´| * |roofv´| * sin(theta) = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1
\
\ So if we calculate the following in the TIDY routine, this will set sidev to
\ a vector of length 1 that's perpendicular to the other two, which is a third
\ orthonormal vector - exactly what we want our third vector to be.
\
\   sidev_x´ = (nosev_z´ * roofv_y´ - nosev_y´ * roofv_z´) / 96
\   sidev_y´ = (nosev_x´ * roofv_z´ - nosev_z´ * roofv_x´) / 96
\   sidev_z´ = (nosev_y´ * roofv_x´ - nosev_x´ * roofv_y´) / 96
\
\ We divide by 96 as we use 96 to represent 1 internally. This means the length
\ of nosev and roofv internally is actually 96, so the length of the
\ cross-product would be 96 96. We want the length of sidev to be 96 (so it
\ represents 1), so we divide by 96 to get the correct result.
\
\ This leaves us with orthonormal vectors, and this is how the TIDY routine
\ tidies the orientation vectors, so the ships don't stretch and warp in space
\ when they are rotated.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following division, where A is a sign-magnitude number and Q is
\ a positive integer:
\
\   A = A / Q
\
\ The value of A is returned as a sign-magnitude number with 96 representing 1,
\ and the maximum value returned is 1 (i.e. 96). This routine is used when
\ normalising vectors, where we represent fractions using integers, so this
\ gives us an approximation to two decimal places.

\ Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\ ======================================
\
\ Summary: The main algorithm behind Elite's many division routines
\
\ References: TIS1, TIS2, DVID4
\
\ Elite implements division in routines like TIS2 using the shift-and-subtract
\ algorithm. This is similar in concept to the shift-and-add algorithm used to
\ implement multiplication in routines like MULT1, but it's essentially the
\ reverse of that algorithm.
\
\ In the same way that shift-and-add implements a binary version of the manual
\ long multiplication process, shift-and-subtract implements long division. We
\ shift bits out of the left end of the number being divided (A), subtracting
\ the largest possible multiple of the divisor (Q) after each shift; each bit of
\ A where we can subtract Q gives a 1 the answer to the division, otherwise it
\ gives a 0.
\
\ In pseudo-code, the algorithm to calculate T = P / Q (with remainder A) looks
\ like this:
\
\   T = 0
\   A = 0
\   for x = 7 to 0
\     A = A << 1
\     A(bit 0) = P(bit x)
\     if A >= Q then
\       A = A − Q
\       T(bit x) = 1
\
\ This is the algorithm implemented in TIS2, except we save space (and make
\ things much more confusing) by using A for both the number being divided and
\ the remainder, building the answer in T instead of P, and using set bits in T
\ to implement the loop counter. The basic idea of shifting and subtracting is
\ the same, though.

\ ===================================
\
\ Summary: The algorithm behind the square root routine
\
\ References: LL5
\
\ The algorithm used to calculate square roots in routine LL5 is related to the
\ division algorithm in TIS2 (see the deep dive on "Shift-and-subtract division"
\ for details), though with a couple of twists. If you think about the division
\ algorithm, it calculates the quotient and remainder from a given dividend and
\ divisor, and the following holds:
\
\   dividend = (quotient * divisor) + remainder
\
\ The problem of calculating the square root is related to this, except we have
\ the following relationship between the arguments and results, where "number"
\ is the number we want to find the square root of:
\
\   number = (root * root) + remainder
\
\ So the number we want to find the root of is equivalent to the dividend in the
\ shift-and-subtract algorithm, and instead of the divisor being fixed, we
\ instead build up the root bit by bit and use that in place of the divisor.
\
\ When generalised to calculate the n-th root, this approach is called the
\ "shifting nth-root" algorithm, and it is explained in various places on the
\ web by minds more devious than mine. The LL5 routine is an application of
\ the algorithm for n = 2, which is why the number ("dividend") and remainder
\ get shifted by two places in each iteration.
\
\ There is a deeper explanation of this exact routine here, though I have to say
\ it makes my head spin more than a little:
\
\    http://6502org.wikidot.com/software-math-sqrt
\
\ Definitely one for the "must study later" pile...

\    Summary: Calculate R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, where A < Q:
\
\   R = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This is a sister routine to LL61, which does the division when A >= Q.
\
\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm that's documented in
\ TIS2, but it leaves the fractional result in the integer range 0-255.
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the

\ Summary: The main routine for drawing 3D wiremesh ships in space
\
\ References: LL9
\
\ The ship-drawing routine is one of the most celebrated aspects of Elite. The
\ 3D graphics are groundbreaking and breathtaking in equal measure, at least as
\ far as 8-bit gome computers are concerned, and even today the way that the
\ ships and space stations move through space is impressive. Without its slick
\ 3D graphics engine, Elite wouldn't have been nearly as immersive, and without
\ its immersion, it just wouldn't have been Elite.
\
\ It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that Elite must have some
\ pretty clever optimisations at the heart of its graphics routines, and this is
\ indeed the case. Elite's 3D objects are stored in a way that makes visibility
\ calculations relatively quick, so we can work out which parts of the ship need
\ to be converted into screen coordinates and drawn, and (more to the point)
\ which ones don't.
\
\ Let's look at visibility distances before moving on to the details of the
\ ship-drawing process.
\
\ Visibility distances
\ --------------------
\ Ships are stored as collections of vertices (i.e. points in space) as you
\ would imagine, and they also come bundled with data on all the edges in the
\ shape, plus data on each face in the model. In addition, each of these
\ vertices, edges and faces comes with its own "visibility distance" figure that
\ enables us to quickly work out which of them are close enough to be worth
\ considering, so we only spend spend time calculating what we need to draw,
\ discarding anything we don't need. The whole process is aimed at narrowing
\ down what we need to do, as quickly and easily as possible.
\
\ These are the visibility rules for the various components of the ship:
\
\   * If the ship is further away than the ship visibility distance in ship byte
\     #13, we draw it as a dot and skip all the wireframe calculations
\
\   * A face is visible if one of these is true:
\
\     * The ship is further away than that face's visibility distance
\
\     * The ship is closer than the face's visibility distance and the face is
\       turned towards us
\
\   * A vertex is visible if at least one face associated with that vertex is
\     visible
\
\   * An edge is visible if at least one face associated with that edge is
\     visible
\
\ These rules get applied as we work our way through all the faces, vertices and
\ edges in the process below.
\
\ The ship line heap
\ ------------------
\ Just as with the planet and sun, we need a way to remove ships from the screen
\ quickly, so it's no surprise that each ship has its own storage heap for doing
\ just that - the ship line heap.
\
\ Each ship has its own heap as part of the main ship line heap, which descends
\ from location WP. The ship line heap is very simple - it contains sets of four
\ coordinates, each of which describes a line in that ship's screen depiction.
\ To draw the ship we simply work through the heap, drawing each line, and to
\ remove the ship from the screen, we repeat the process.
\
\ The first byte of the heap contains the total number of bytes in the heap.
\ Each line is stored as four bytes - X1, Y1, X2, Y2 - which describe the start
\ and end screen coordinates for that line.
\
\ When a ship is added to our local bubble of universe, a ship line heap is
\ reserved for that ship, with the heap size given in byte #5 of the ship's
\ blueprint. This gives the maximum heap size needed for plotting ship, which
\ is:
\
\   1 + 4 * max. no of visible edges
\
\ as there are four bytes needed for each line, plus 1 for the size byte at the
\ start. So for the Sidewinder there are never more than 15 edges visible, so
\ there will never be more than 15 lines on the ship line heap, so the maximum
\ heap size is 1 + 4 * 15 = 61 bytes.
\
\ The drawing workflow
\ --------------------
\ The following process summarises the different steps in the LL9 routine. The
\ part numbers match the breakdown of the source code, so you can refer to the
\ code as you go.
\
\ 1/11 LL9
\
\   * If the ship is a planet or sun, jump to PLANET to draw it
\
\   * If the ship has just been killed but isn't yet exploding, initialise a new
\     explosion cloud
\
\   * If the ship is behind us, then it isn't visible, so remove it from the
\     screen (by calling part 11 below to redraw it using EOR logic) and we're
\     done
\
\ 2/11
\
\   * If the ship is outside of our field of view, remove it from the screen and
\     we're done
\
\   * If the ship is a long way away, jump to SHPPT to remove it from the screen
\     and redraw it as a dot
\
\   * Flag the ship's laser vertex in the XX3 buffer, so we can check it in part
\     9 when processing laser fire
\
\   * Calculate the ship's distance from us, reduced to a value in the range
\     0-31 so it's testable against visibility distances
\
\   * If the ship is further away than the ship blueprint's visibility distance,
\     jump to SHPPT to remove it from the screen and redraw it as a dot
\
\ 3/11
\
\   * Fetch the ship's orientation vectors and normalise them
\
\   * Fetch the ship's x, y and z coordinates in space
\
\ 4/11
\
\   * If the ship is exploding, set all the faces to be visible and skip down to
\     part 6
\
\ 5/11
\
\   * Work out the scale factor for the face normals so we can make them as big
\     as possible while not overflowing, incorporating the scale factor from the
\     blueprint
\
\   * Process the ship's faces and work out if they're visible, as follows:
\
\     * If the ship is further away than a face's visibility distance, mark it
\       as visible (this is the opposite to the other visibility distance tests)
\
\     * Otherwise work out if the face is pointing towards us or away from us
\       using the dot product (see the deep dive on "Back-face culling")
\
\ 6/11
\
\   * Process the ship's vertices and work out which ones are visible:
\
\     * If the ship is further away than the vertex's visibility distance, it is
\       not visible
\
\     * If at least one face associated with this vertex is visible, the vertex
\       is visible
\
\   * For visible vertices only:
\
\     * Calculate the space coordinates of that vertex (see the deep dive on
\       "Calculating vertex coordinates"), starting the calculation in part 6...
\
\ 7/11
\
\     * ...and finishing it in part 7, before moving on to part 8...
\
\ 8/11
\
\     * ...to convert the visible vertex's space coordinates into screen
\       coordinates
\
\ 9/11
\
\   * If the ship is exploding, jump to DOEXP to display the explosion cloud
\
\   * Remove the ship from the screen
\
\   * If the ship is firing at us and its laser vertex (which we tagged in part
\     2) is visible, then calculate the laser beam line coordinates and add them
\     to the ship line heap
\
\ 10/11
\
\   * Process the ship's edges and work out which ones are visible:
\
\     * If the ship is further away than the edge's visibility distance, it is
\       not visible
\
\     * If at least one face associated with this edge is visible, the edge is
\       visible
\
\   * For visible edges, add this edge to the ship line heap (i.e. add the
\     screen coordinates of the start and end vertices)
\
\ 11/11
\
\   * Draw the lines in the ship line heap, which draws the ship on screen (or
\     removes it, if the ship is already on screen)

\ Deep dive: Back-face culling
\ ============================
\
\ Summary: How Elite draws solid-looking 3D ships by only drawing visible faces
\
\ References: LL9 (Part 5 of 11)
\
\ One of the reasons that Elite's 3D wireframe ships look so good is because
\ you can't see through them - they look genuinely solid. This is down to a
\ process called "back-face culling", a mathematical process that works out
\ which faces of the ship are visible to the viewer and which ones aren't. It
\ then discards (or "culls") any faces that aren't visible and only draws those
\ that we can actually see. This prevents the wireframes from being see-through,
\ and this gives the ships a real sense of solidity.
\
\ The main principle behind back-face culling is the dot product. This simple
\ mathematical operation takes two vectors and produces a scalar value that is
\ in essence a kind of mathematical application of one vector to the other, of
\ taking the "essence" of one vector and applying it to another. For the
\ purposes of back-face culling in Elite, we use the dot product in two distinct
\ ways.
\
\ Direction of the face normal
\ ----------------------------
\ The first use is to calculate whether a face is pointing towards us or away
\ from us, so we can decide whether to draw it. For this we use a property of
\ the dot product that's almost tailor-made for solving this problem: if the dot
\ product of two vectors is negative, then the angle between them is greater
\ than 90 degrees (and by extension, if it is positive then the angle is less
\ than 90 degrees, while a dot product of 0 means they are at exactly 90 degrees
\ to each other).
\
\ Now, consider a face of one of our ships, and take the surface normal vector
\ of that face. This is the vector that sticks out of the surface of the face at
\ 90 degrees to the surface (so a ship with its face normals attached would look
\ like a strange, space-faring hedgehog). Now think about rotating that face in
\ space, and you can see that if that face normal is pointing towards us - in
\ other words if the spike is pointing in our general direction, more towards us
\ than away from us - then we can see the front of the face, while if the face
\ normal (the spike) is pointing away from us, then the face is also pointing
\ away from us and we can't see it.
\
\ The normal is effectively pointing in the direction of the face, so if it is
\ pointing in our general direction, then the face is pointing towards us and we
\ can see it; similarly, if the normal is pointing away from us, then the face
\ is also pointing away from us, and we can't see it. Finally, if the face is
\ exactly side on to us, it's on the cusp of being visible and invisible to us.
\
\ It looks like this (though you'll have to imagine that the normals are at
\ 90 degrees, as that's pretty difficult to do in ASCII):
\
\                                /                        `.   /   normal points
\                               /      normal points        `./    towards us,
\   line of sight ----->       /`.     away, face            /     face visible
\                             /   `.   not visible          /
\
\ The solid lines represent the faces, while the dotted lines represent the
\ normals. On the left the normal is pointing away from us and the face is
\ turned away from us, so it's not visible, while on the right the normal is
\ pointing towards us and so is the face, so it's visible.
\
\ So, when the face normal is pointing away from us, the face is hidden from us.
\ To put this another way, when the angle between the face normal and our line
\ of sight is greater than 90 degrees, then the face normal is pointing away
\ from us and the face is not visible. Similarly, when the angle is less than 90
\ degrees, the normal is pointing towards us, so the face is visible.
\
\ This means that we can calculate the visibility of a face by calculating the
\ following dot product:
\
\   line of sight vector . face normal vector
\
\ If the result of this dot product is negative, then the face is visible; if
\ it's positive, it isn't visible; and if it's zero it's edge on to us.
\
\ Line of sight vector
\ --------------------
\ We already have the face normal vector, as that's how faces are stored in the
\ memory (see the ship blueprints documentation at XX21 for more information on
\ this). So how can we calculate the line of sight vector?
\
\ The first solution that springs to mind is to use the vector from our position
\ to the ship we are trying to draw. Our ship is always at the origin (0, 0, 0),
\ so this would mean the line of sight vector would be the vector from the
\ origin to the ship at (x, y, z), or [x y z]. This is close, but it isn't quite
\ right as the line of sight we are interested in is towards the face, not the
\ centre of the ship.
\
\ Luckily, any point on the face will do for our calculation, so we just need to
\ find the vector from our position to any point on the face, and the dot
\ product will work fine. Indeed, we can extend that to say that any point on
\ the plane containing the face will suffice; if you think about it, extending
\ the face in all directions wouldn't change its visibility to us, so it won't
\ change the calculation if we pick a point that is outside the limits of the
\ actual face we want to draw. It just has to be in the same plane as the face
\ for this to work.
\
\ Given this, perhaps we can get hold of a vector that goes from the ship's
\ centre to a point on the extended face plane? As then we could define our line
\ of sight vector by adding the vector to the ship's centre, and the vector from
\ the ship's centre to the extended face plane.
\
\ Luckily - well, it isn't luck, it's by design, but it feels lucky - this is
\ exactly how faces are stored in Elite. Each face is stored as a face normal
\ vector, but that normal is specifically designed to be the vector from the
\ centre of the ship to the nearest point on the extended face plane. The
\ direction of the vector stored in the ship's blueprint is parallel to the
\ face normal (the hedgehog spike), but its magnitude (i.e. the vector's length)
\ is set to the distance from the ship's centre to the extended face plane. So,
\ by design, we can add this vector to the ship's position in space to get the
\ line of sight vector from our ship to a point on the face plane, like so:
\
\   line of sight vector = [x y z] + face normal vector
\
\ and we can then calculate the dot product of this vector with the face normal
\ vector to get our positive or negative result, which determines whether this
\ face is hidden or visible.
\
\ (Incidentally, the face normal vector that's stored in the ship's blueprint
\ goes from the ship's centre to the nearest point on the extended face plane,
\ as the vector is a normal, though we don't need to use this fact, it's just
\ an interesting consequence of how this is all set up.)
\
\ Projecting onto the orientation vector space
\ --------------------------------------------
\ So are we done? Not quite. The maths is all good, but the way the coordinates
\ and vectors are stored means we have to do a bit more geometry before we can
\ plug the values into our dot product equation.
\
\ The problem is that the vector from our position to the ship we're displaying
\ uses a different set of axes to the ship's blueprint. As we cavort through
\ space, pitching and rolling away, the x-axis is always pointing to the right
\ on screen, the y-axis always points up, and the z-axis always points into the
\ screen. This is always the case, even if we switch views (this is where the
\ PLUT routine comes in, as it switches the axes around to maintain this
\ relationship between the screen and the axes). When we roll, pitch and travel
\ through space, we don't actually roll or pitch, but instead we rotate the
\ universe around us (this is done in the MVEIT routine). On top of this, each
\ ship has its own set of orientation vectors - nosev, roofv and sidev - that
\ determine the direction that the ship is pointing.
\
\ The problem is that the face normal vector in the ship's blueprint is stored
\ in terms of an unrotated ship. Ship coordinates are stored with the x, y and
\ z axes along the orientation vectors, so if we were sitting in the ship,
\ the x-coordinate of the face normal vector would be pointing to our right, the
\ y-coordinate would be pointing up, and the z-coordinate would be pointing
\ forward, because that's how the coordinates are stored. This intentionally
\ coincides with the way the orientation vectors point; from the perspective of
\ the pilot of the other ship, sidev is the x-axis going off to the right, roofv
\ is the y-axis going up, and the z-axis is nosev, heading forward. The face
\ normal vectors are stored with reference to these orientation vectors as axes;
\ mathematically speaking, the ship's orientation vectors form an orthonormal
\ basis for the Euclidean space in which the face normals are expressed.
\
\ So somehow we need to merge these two coordinate systems - the orientation of
\ the universe from the perspective of our ship vs the orientation of the
\ universe from the perspective of the other ship. Luckily there's an easy
\ solution, and again it involves the dot product.
\
\ The feature of the dot product that we use to merge the coordinate systems is
\ called "scalar projection". This says that given a vector and a unit vector,
\ we can calculate the projection of the vector onto the unit vector by simply
\ calculating the dot product. If we do this with a vector and three unit
\ vectors, then the dot product gives us that vector, expressed in terms of the
\ three unit vectors - in other words, this is how we convert coordinates from
\ one set of axes to another.
\
\ In our case, we have the following equation to calculate:
\
\   line of sight vector . face normal vector
\
\ where:
\
\   line of sight vector = [x y z] + face normal vector
\
\ so if we can convert [x y z] to use the same axes as the face normal vector,
\ then we can do our calculation. As discussed above, the face normal vector
\ uses the ship's orientation vectors as its axes, and we know that the
\ orientation vectors are unit vectors because they are orthonormal (and we
\ keep calling the TIDY routine to ensure that they stay this way). So we can
\ project the [x y z] vector onto each of the orientation vectors in turn, like
\ this:
\
\   [x y z] projected onto sidev = [x y z] . sidev
\   [x y z] projected onto roofv = [x y z] . roofv
\   [x y z] projected onto nosev = [x y z] . nosev
\
\ and because the orientation vectors are effectively the x, y and z axes for
\ the ship's space, we can combine them into our projected line of sight vector
\ like this:
\
\                              [ [x y z] . sidev ]
\   projected [x y z] vector = [ [x y z] . roofv ]
\                              [ [x y z] . nosev ]
\
\ The final step is to combine all of the above into our final equation. This is
\ the value we want to calculate:
\
\   line of sight vector . face normal vector
\
\ and we know that:
\
\   line of sight vector = [x y z] + face normal vector
\
\ so if we now project the [x y z] vector into the same space as the face
\ normals so we can combine them properly, we get:
\
\   line of sight vector = projected [x y z] vector + face normal vector
\
\                          [ [x y z] . sidev ]   [ normal_x ]
\                        = [ [x y z] . roofv ] + [ normal_y ]
\                          [ [x y z] . nosev ]   [ normal_z ]
\
\                          [ [x y z] . sidev + normal_x ]
\                        = [ [x y z] . roofv + normal_y ]
\                          [ [x y z] . nosev + normal_z ]
\
\ and if we substitute this into our final calculation, we can calculate the dot
\ product as follows:
\
\                [ [x y z] . sidev + normal_x ]   [ normal_x ]
\   visibility = [ [x y z] . roofv + normal_y ] . [ normal_y ]
\                [ [x y z] . nosev + normal_z ]   [ normal_z ]
\
\ If the result is negative the face is visible, otherwise it is not visible.
\
\ This is exactly what happens in part 5 of the LL9 routine. We set the block of
\ memory at XX15 to the left-hand side of the final calculation and the block at
\ XX12 block to the right-hand side, and calculate the dot product XX12 . XX15
\ to tell us whether or not this face is visible, which we store in the table at
\ XX2. This gets repeated for all the faces until XX2 contains the visibilities
\ of all the faces for this ship.

\ those that are visible, it starts the process of calculating the screen
\ coordinates of each vertex

\
\ Summary: Determining whether a ship's vertex is visible or hidden from us
\
\ References: LL9 (Part 6 of 11)
\
\ To understand the following, you'll probably want to have a look through the
\ deep dive on "Back-face culling", which describes how we can work out whether
\ or not a ship's face is visible.
\
\ As part of the back-face cull, we projected the vector [x y z] onto the
\ orientation vector space like this:
\
\   [x y z] projected onto sidev = [x y z] . sidev
\   [x y z] projected onto roofv = [x y z] . roofv
\   [x y z] projected onto nosev = [x y z] . nosev
\
\ We can express this exact same calculation in terms of matrix multiplication:
\
\   [ sidev ]   [ x ]
\   [ roofv ] . [ y ]
\   [ nosev ]   [ z ]
\
\ or, expanding it out fully:
\
\                       [ sidev_x sidev_y sidev_z ]   [ x ]
\   projected [x y z] = [ roofv_x roofv_y roofv_z ] . [ y ]
\                       [ nosev_x nosev_y nosev_z ]   [ z ]
\
\ This is just a different way of expressing the exact same equation as we used
\ in part 5 of LL9, just with a matrix instead of individual dot products.
\
\ Transposing the rotation matrix
\ -------------------------------
\ So the inverse matrix will map vectors in the orientation vector space back
\ into normal ship space. The inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose, so
\ this is the calculation:
\
\                       [ sidev_x roofv_x nosev_x ]   [ x ]
\   projected [x y z] = [ sidev_y roofv_y nosev_y ] . [ y ]
\                       [ sidev_z roofv_z nosev_z ]   [ z ]
\
\ This takes a vector, which goes from the ship's centre to the vertex and is
\ expressed in terms of the ship's axes (i.e. its orientation vectors), and
\ instead expresses it in terms of our ship's axes (i.e. our orientation
\ vectors).
\
\ Given this new vector, we can add the vector from our ship to the other ship,
\ to get the vector from us to the vertex, expressed in our ship's coordinates:
\
\                      [ sidev_x roofv_x nosev_x ]   [ x ]   [ x ]
\   vector to vertex = [ sidev_y roofv_y nosev_y ] . [ y ] + [ y ]
\                      [ sidev_z roofv_z nosev_z ]   [ z ]   [ z ]
\
\ The code to calculate this equation takes up parts 6 and 7 of LL9. It's in two
\ parts because there are two small subroutines that have rudely inserted
\ themselves just before the big reveal. These are used by part 8 and don't play
\ a part in this calculation (except to make it harder to follow).

                        \ The first task is to set up the inverse matrix, ready
                        \ for us to send to the dot product routine at LL51.
                        \ Back up in part 3, we set up the following variables:
                        \
                        \   * XX16(1 0) = sidev_x
                        \   * XX16(3 2) = sidev_y
                        \   * XX16(5 4) = sidev_z
                        \
                        \   * XX16(7 6) = roofv_x
                        \   * XX16(9 8) = roofv_y
                        \   * XX16(11 10) = roofv_z
                        \
                        \   * XX16(13 12) = nosev_x
                        \   * XX16(15 14) = nosev_y
                        \   * XX16(17 16) = nosev_z
                        \
                        \ and we then scaled the vectors to give the following:

\    Summary: Move a point along a line until it is on-screen
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Given a point (x1, y1), a gradient and a direction of slope, move the point
\ along the line until it is on-screen, so this effectively clips the (x1, y1)
\ end of a line to be on the screen.
\
\ See the deep dive on "Line-clipping" for more details.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)
\
\   XX15(3 2)           y1 as a 16-bit coordinate (y1_hi y1_lo)
\
\   XX12+2              The line's gradient * 256 (so 1.0 = 256)
\
\   XX12+3              The direction of slope:
\
\                         * Positive (bit 7 clear) = top left to bottom right
\
\                         * Negative (bit 7 set) = top right to bottom left
\
\   T                   The type of slope:
\
\                         * 0 if it's more vertical than horizontal
\
\                         * &FF if it's more horizontal than vertical
\
\ Returns:
\
\   XX15                x1 as an 8-bit coordinate

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or
\ returns an error if it can't be clipped to fit. The arguments are 16-bit
\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.
\
\ This part sets XX13 to reflect which of the two points are on-screen and
\ off-screen.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15(1 0)           x1 as a 16-bit coordinate (x1_hi x1_lo)
\
\   XX15(3 2)           y1 as a 16-bit coordinate (y1_hi y1_lo)
\
\   XX15(5 4)           x2 as a 16-bit coordinate (x2_hi x2_lo)
\
\   XX12(1 0)           y2 as a 16-bit coordinate (y2_hi y2_lo)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   (X1, Y1)            Screen coordinate of the start of the clipped line
\
\   (X2, Y2)            Screen coordinate of the end of the clipped line
\
\   C flag              Clear if the clipped line fits on-screen, set if it
\                       doesn't
\
\   XX13                The state of the original coordinates on-screen:

\
\                       So XX13 is non-zero if the end of the line was clipped,

\ Deep dive: Line-clipping
\ ========================
\
\ Summary: Efficiently clipping an extended line to the part that's on-screen
\
\ References: LL145, LL118
\
\ Space is big. Vintage computer screens, however, are not big. Elite's space
\ view is a whopping 256 pixels across and 192 pixels high, and somehow we have
\ to cram planets, suns and seat-of-the-pants space battles into this tiny,
\ thumbnail-sized bit of cathode-ray real estate. This isn't easy.
\
\ The first part of the solution is to simulate not only the part of space
\ that's visible on-screen, but the surroundings too. Elite's extended screen
\ coordinate system takes care of this - see the deep dive on "Extended screen
\ coordinates" for details.
\
\ The second part of the solution is efficient line-clipping. The extended
\ screen coordinate system caters for objects outside of the screen bounds, so
\ when the game actually comes to draw these objects in the space view, it needs
\ to work out exactly which lines to draw on-screen, and that's where the
\ line-clipping routines come in. They take lines made up of 16-bit coordinates
\ and work out whether any of that line is on-screen, and return the portion
\ that's visible. In a sense, the screen is a small portal onto the wider
\ universe, and line-clipping is the process of working out what we can see
\ through that portal.
\
\ Line-clipping is done in two stages. The first stage in routine LL145 works
\ out whether the lone intersects the screen at any point, and if it does, then
\ the second stage in routine LL118 clips the line and returns the portion that
\ appears on-screen, which we then need to draw.
\
\ Lets see how these two stages work.
\
\ LL145: Working out whether to clip a line
\ -----------------------------------------
\ The line-clipping routine starts with a call to LL145, which checks whether
\ the line is worth clipping - in other words, whether the line passes through
\ the screen at any point. As the actual clipping process the LL118 routine, is
\ quite involved, it's worth spending time checking whether we need to call it
\ at all.
\
\ Here's a breakdown of how LL145 determines whether a line is partly or wholly
\ on screen, and therefore whether it's worth sending to LL118 to be clipped.
\
\ Part 1
\
\   * If both coordinates are on-screen, then return with success as the line
\     doesn't need clipping and already fits on-screen
\
\   * Otherwise, set XX13 to reflect which point(s) are on-screen and off-screen
\
\ Part 2
\
\   * If both points are off-screen and both points are past the same screen
\     edge, then return with failure
\
\   * If moving both points left by one screen doesn't move at least one of them
\     past the left edge of the screen (i.e. if neither of them is in the
\     vertical screen-wide strip to the right of the screen), return with
\     failure
\
\   * If moving both points up by one screen doesn't move at least one of them
\     past the top edge of the screen (i.e. if neither of them is in the
\     horizontal screen-high strip below the bottom of the screen), return with
\     failure (this test needs to be done only using the space view portion of
\     the screen)
\
\ Part 3
\
\   * Calculate the line gradient from the 16-bit coordinates, calculating it
\     the right way round to make it a fractional gradient:
\
\     * Calculate (delta_x / delta_y) if delta_x < delta_y
\
\     * Calculate (delta_y / delta_x) if delta_x >= delta_y
\
\ Part 4
\
\   * Do the actual clipping by calling LL118 to move one end of the line at a
\     time (so if both points need moving on-screen, we call LL118 twice)
\
\   * If both the original coordinates were off-screen, double-check that the
\     clipped line is indeed on-screen, and if not return with failure
\
\   * Return the clipped line with success, and with XX13 and SWAP set to
\     describe the kind of clipping we had to do
\
\ LL118: Clipping a line
\ ----------------------
\ LL118 is called by LL145 when we think a line crosses the screen. It only
\ clips one end of the line, so if LL145 finds that both ends need clipping,
\ it calls LL118 twice, once for each end.
\
\ This is how it works. Given a point (x1, y1), we move the point along the line
\ until it is on-screen, which effectively clips the (x1, y1) end of a line to
\ be on the screen. The movement process depends on the line's gradient, the
\ direction of slope (i.e. top left to bottom right, or top right to bottom
\ left), and the steepness of slope (i.e. is it more vertical than horizontal).
\
\ For example, if x1 is negative, i.e. off the left edge of the screen, we move
\ the point right along the line until x1 = 0. We calculate the new y1 by
\ multiplying the distance travelled in the x-direction by the gradient.
\
\ Similar logic is applied when the point is off-screen to the right, top or
\ bottom. Also, because the gradient is always stored as a fractional value
\ (it's less than 1.0, just expressed as a byte), then when the line is more
\ vertical than horizontal, the value stored is actually 1 / gradient, as that
\ way it fits into the byte. Because of this, if the line is more vertical than
\ horizontal, we have to divide by the gradient rather than multiply to get the
\ same result.

\ Deep dive: Ship blueprints
\ ==========================
\
\ Summary: Specifications for all the different types of ship in the universe
\
\ References: XX21, SHIP1, SHIP4
\
\ Every ship in Elite has a blueprint that defines that ship's characteristics
\ (note that in this context, "ship" refers not only to ships, but also cargo
\ canisters, space stations, escape pods, missiles and asteroids). These
\ blueprints are the in-game equivalent of the last section of the Space Traders
\ Flight Training Manual - a real life version of "Jane's Galactic Ships and
\ Remote Colonial Construction, 5th Edition, 3205" (pub. Trantor House).
\
\ There is a lookup table at XX21 that contains the addresses of all the ship
\ blueprints used in the game. Ship type 1 (the Sidewinder at SHIP1) is first in
\ the table, then ship type 2 (the Viper at SHIP2) is next, and so on up to ship
\ type 13 (the escape pod at SHIP13). For all ships except the Python, the
\ blueprints themselves are stored in sequence just after the table; the Python
\ is stored at SHIP4, just above screen memory at &7F00.
\
\ The 13 ship types are as follows, along with the configuration variables where
\ they exist:
\
\   1.  Sidewinder
\   2.  Viper (COPS)
\   3.  Mamba
\   4.  Python
\   5.  Cobra Mk III bounty hunter
\   6.  Thargoid (THG)
\   7.  Cobra Mk III trader (CYL)
\   9.  Missile (MSL)
\   10. Asteroid (AST)
\   11. Cargo (OIL)
\   12. Thargon (TGL)
\   13. Escape pod (ESC)
\
\ Each ship blueprint defines a whole range of attributes, such as the ship's
\ maximum speed, the number of missiles it can carry, and the size of the target
\ area we need to hit with our laser. It also contains data that's used when
\ managing the ship once its spawned inside our local bubble of universe, like
\ the maximum size of the ship line heap.
\
\ The blueprint also contains all the data we need to draw the ship on-screen.
\ This includes the ship's vertices, edges and faces, the visibility distances,
\ and the face normal scale factor, all of which are used in the ship drawing
\ routine at LL9. See the deep dive on "Drawing ships" for more details.
\
\ Ship characteristics
\ --------------------
\ For each ship blueprint, the first 20 bytes define the main characteristics of
\ this ship type. They are as follows:
\
\   * Byte #0           Maximum number of cargo canisters released when
\                       destroyed
\
\   * Byte #1-2         The ship's targetable area, which represents how far the
\                       ship can be from the centre of our crosshairs and still
\                       be locked onto by our missiles or hit by our lasers, as
\                       described in the HITCH routine (16-bit value, 1 = low
\                       byte, 2 = high byte)
\
\   * Byte #3           Edges data offset low byte (offset is from byte #0)
\
\   * Byte #4           Faces data offset low byte (offset is from byte #0)
\
\   * Byte #5           Maximum heap size for plotting ship = 1 + 4 * max. no of
\                       visible edges
\
\   * Byte #6           Number * 4 of the vertex used for the ship's laser
\                       position, for when the ship fires its lasers
\
\   * Byte #7           Explosion count = 4 * n + 6, where n = number of
\                       vertices used as origins for explosion clouds
\
\   * Byte #8           Number of vertices * 6
\
\   * Byte #9           Number of edges
\
\   * Byte #10-11       The bounty awarded for the destruction of this ship in
\                       Cr * 10 (16-bit little-endian value, 10 = low byte,
\                       11 = high byte)
\
\   * Byte #12          Number of faces * 4
\
\   * Byte #13          Visibility distance, beyond which we show the ship as a
\                       dot
\
\   * Byte #14          Maximum energy/shields
\
\   * Byte #15          Maximum speed
\
\   * Byte #16          Edges data offset high byte (can be negative and point
\                       to another ship's edge net)
\
\   * Byte #17          Faces data offset high byte
\
\   * Byte #18          Face normals are scaled down by 2 ^ this value to enable
\                       us to store more accurate fractional data in the table
\
\   * Byte #19          %00 lll mmm, where:
\
\                         * Bits 0-2 = number of missiles
\
\                         * Bits 3-5 = laser power
\
\ Vertex definitions
\ ------------------
\ Next come the vertex definitions. Each vertex is made up of eight values
\ stored in six bytes, as follows:
\
\   * Byte #0           Magnitude of the vertex's x-coordinate, with the origin
\                       in the middle of the ship
\
\   * Byte #1           Magnitude of the vertex's y-coordinate
\
\   * Byte #2           Magnitude of the vertex's z-coordinate
\
\   * Byte #3           %xyz vvvvv, where:
\
\                         * Bits 0-4 = visibility distance, beyond which the
\                           vertex is not shown
\
\                         * Bits 7-5 = the sign bits of x, y and z
\
\   * Byte #4           %ffff ffff, where:
\
\                          * Bits 0-3 = the number of face 1
\
\                          * Bits 4-7 = the number of face 2
\
\   * Byte #5           %ffff ffff, where:
\
\                          * Bits 0-3 = the number of face 3
\
\                          * Bits 4-7 = the number of face 4
\
\ Edge definitions
\ ----------------
\ Then we have the edge definitions. Each edge is made up of five values stored
\ in four bytes, as follows:
\
\   * Byte #0           Visibility distance, beyond which the edge is not shown
\
\   * Byte #1           %ffff ffff, where:
\
\                         * Bits 0-3 = the number of face 1
\
\                         * Bits 4-7 = the number of face 2
\
\   * Byte #2           The number of the vertex at the start the edge
\
\   * Byte #3           The number of the vertex at the end of the edge
\
\ Face definitions
\ ----------------
\ Finally we have the face definitions. Each face is made up of four values
\ stored in four bytes, as follows. Note that the visibility distance works in
\ the opposite way for faces than for the ship, vertices and edges, in that the
\ face is always shown when it's further away than the visibility distance.
\
\   * Byte #0           %xyz vvvvv, where:
\
\                         * Bits 0-4 = visibility distance, beyond which the
\                           face is always shown
\
\                         * Bits 7-5 = the sign bits of normal_x, normal_y and
\                           normal_z
\
\   * Byte #1           Magnitude of the face normal's x-coordinate, normal_x
\
\   * Byte #2           Magnitude of the face normal's y-coordinate, normal_y
\
\   * Byte #3           Magnitude of the face normal's z-coordinate, normal_z
\
\ To make the source code easier to follow, we use three macros (called VERTEX,
\ EDGE and FACE) that let us separate out the different values, and which
\ squash the data into the above bytes at compile time.
